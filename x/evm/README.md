# x/evm — Ethermint EVM Module (Placeholder)

This directory is reserved for the Ethermint EVM module integration.

In the future, NOORCHAIN will use Ethermint to provide:

- full EVM compatibility
- deployment and execution of Solidity smart contracts
- JSON-RPC endpoints for wallets and tools

At this stage, this folder only exists as a structural placeholder.
The actual EVM logic will be wired later by importing Ethermint modules.
