# x/feemarket — EVM Fee Market Module (Placeholder)

This directory is reserved for the Ethermint Fee Market module integration.

Planned responsibilities:

- Implement EIP-1559-style gas fee logic for EVM transactions
- Manage base fee, priority fee and gas pricing rules
- Provide a stable and predictable fee model for NOORCHAIN's EVM layer

For now, this folder is only a structural placeholder.
The actual module wiring will be added in a later technical phase.
