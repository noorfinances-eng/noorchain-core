NOORCHAIN Genesis Parameters 2.1
NOORCHAIN — Genesis Parameters
Version 2.1
Last Updated: 10.12.2025

1. Purpose of This Document
This document defines the technical and economic parameters applied at NOORCHAIN mainnet genesis under the NOORCHAIN 2.1 architecture.
It ensures consistency between:
core protocol configuration,
EVM chain identity and execution rules,
permissioned consensus and validator governance boundaries,
PoSS as an application-layer mechanism (not consensus),
Swiss Legal Light CH compliance constraints,
the immutable 5 / 5 / 5 / 5 / 80 allocation model.
These rules are part of the Genesis Pack reference set.
In case of conflict, the Foundation Statutes and Legal Architecture documents prevail.
2. Core Chain Parameters (NOORCHAIN 2.1 — Sovereign EVM L1)
2.1 Chain Identity
Chain Name: noorchain
EVM Chain ID: 2121 (hex: 0x849)
Network Type: sovereign Layer-1 (not an L2, not Ethereum mainnet)
Execution Environment: EVM-compatible, wallet/tooling oriented
2.2 Native Token Denomination
Base Denom: unur
Display Denom: NUR
Decimals: 18
Native Utility: gas fees, protocol operations, and ecosystem utilities.
NUR is not an investment instrument, does not embed yield, and does not constitute a financial product.
2.3 Block Production and Capacity
Block production is controlled by the permissioned BFT consensus layer.
Block time and capacity parameters are defined as genesis defaults and may be adjusted by governance procedures, provided they do not violate the immutable constraints and Legal Light boundaries.
No parameter in this section may be used to introduce:
staking yield dynamics,
token-holder reward programs,
financial promise framing.
2.4 Fee Policy (Genesis Posture)
Fees are paid in NUR and remain within the NOORCHAIN ecosystem.
Genesis fee posture is designed to be simple, auditable, and institution-friendly:
no staking-based fee rebates,
no protocol-level yield framing,
no financial incentives embedded in fee mechanics.
If any fee market mechanism is enabled or adjusted, it must remain compatible with the Legal Light CH perimeter and must be documented publicly.
3. Consensus and Validator Governance (Permissioned BFT)
3.1 Consensus Model
NOORCHAIN 2.1 uses a permissioned BFT consensus model.
The validator set is permissioned at genesis to ensure:
deterministic finality,
institutional-grade operational control,
auditability and accountability of operators,
a stable baseline for early-stage institutional onboarding.
3.2 No Public Staking at Genesis
NOORCHAIN does not rely on token staking as a participation requirement at genesis.
There is no staking APR/APY posture and no passive income mechanism tied to consensus participation.
3.3 Validator Set Governance
Validator set management is governed by the Foundation governance perimeter and executed through documented procedures under multi-signature control.
Validator governance must remain:
transparent,
documented,
non-financial in posture,
compatible with Swiss Legal Light constraints.
4. PoSS Parameters (Application Layer — Not Consensus)
4.1 Scope and Separation of Concerns
PoSS (Proof of Signal Social) is an application-layer mechanism for social recognition and governance signals.
PoSS is not the consensus mechanism.
Consensus provides security and finality.
PoSS provides a structured social recognition layer, based on curator validation and signed snapshots.
This separation is structural and must not be altered at genesis or through governance.
4.2 PoSS Activation Posture at Genesis
PoSS may be deployed in a controlled manner after genesis.
Genesis posture is:
PoSS does not secure the chain,
PoSS does not modify consensus rules,
PoSS does not introduce staking, yield, or investment characteristics.
Any PoSS activation must remain compliant and must be documented as part of the public governance records.
4.3 Structural PoSS Invariants (Non-Modifiable)
The following PoSS rules are immutable:
Reward split: 70% participant / 30% curator
Fixed supply constraint: total supply is immutable
No discretionary minting: issuance is rule-bound
Halving cycle: every 8 years (structural)
PoSS rewards represent validated social signals, not financial compensation or yield.
5. Economic Parameters (Immutable)
5.1 Total Supply
Total Supply: 299,792,458 NUR
Inflation: 0% permanent
This supply is fixed forever and cannot be increased by governance, upgrades, or operational decisions.
5.2 Allocation Model (5 / 5 / 5 / 5 / 80)
Genesis distribution applies the immutable 5 / 5 / 5 / 5 / 80 model:
Foundation: 5% (multi-sig controlled)
Dev Sàrl: 5% (functional allocation)
PoSS Stimulus: 5% (non-financial ecosystem activation)
Pre-sale Pool: 5% (optional, private, regulated, vested)
PoSS Mintable Reserve: 80% (released only through PoSS rules and halving)
Allocation pools cannot be used as collateral or financial guarantees.
No governance mechanism may modify allocation percentages.
6. Governance Limits (Hard Constraints)
Governance cannot modify:
total supply (299,792,458 NUR),
allocation percentages (5 / 5 / 5 / 5 / 80),
PoSS structural reward split (70/30),
halving period (8 years),
the prohibition of discretionary minting,
Legal Light CH restrictions,
the separation PoSS ≠ consensus.
Governance may adjust operational parameters only, provided they remain within:
the immutable perimeter,
the Legal Light CH perimeter,
documented public procedures.
7. EVM Genesis Configuration
7.1 Genesis World State
The EVM world state is initialised at genesis.
Any pre-deployed system contracts, if used, must be:
explicitly listed,
addressed deterministically,
documented in the Genesis Pack release materials,
auditable and reproducible.
7.2 Compatibility Posture
NOORCHAIN 2.1 targets compatibility with standard Ethereum tooling where feasible, without positioning itself as a DeFi or financial smart-contract platform.
EVM compatibility exists to support:
institutional tooling,
wallet interoperability,
controlled social-utility applications,
auditable public-good integrations.
8. Non-Financial and Non-Custodial Commitments (Genesis-Level Posture)
NOORCHAIN operates under Swiss Legal Light CH constraints.
At genesis and thereafter, NOORCHAIN commits to:
no custody of user assets,
no yield or return promises,
no protocol-level staking income framing,
no internal fiat conversion,
transparent documentation and change logs,
strict separation between Foundation governance and Development operations.
9. Summary
These genesis parameters define NOORCHAIN 2.1 mainnet posture:
sovereign EVM Layer-1,
permissioned BFT consensus,
NUR as a utility token (non-financial, non-custodial),
PoSS as an application-layer mechanism (not consensus),
immutable economic rules (fixed supply, 5-pool allocation, 70/30 split, 8-year halving),
governance constrained by Legal Light CH.
Version 2.1 is valid for the NOORCHAIN  Genesis Pack public reference and may only be updated through documented governance procedures where permitted, without altering immutable constraints.
