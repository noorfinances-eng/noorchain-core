NOORCHAIN — Brandbook 1.2
Visual Identity & Logo System
Version 1.1 — 2025

1. LOGO SYSTEM
1.1 Primary Logo (Full Logo)
The primary NOORCHAIN logo is the official visual signature of the project.
It combines:
•	the N-frame symbol
•	the NOORCHAIN wordmark
Recommended uses:
•	Main website header
•	Official documents and PDFs
•	Media kits
•	Press releases and presentations
The full logo should be used whenever there is enough horizontal space and when NOORCHAIN must be clearly identified (homepage, cover pages, slide titles, etc.).

1.2 Symbol Mark (The N-Frame)
The N-frame is the core symbol of the brand.
It represents structure, participation and upward validation, echoing the PoSS mechanism.
Symbolic meaning:
•	Left turquoise bar → Initiator / Participant
•	Right blue bar → Curator / Validation
•	Diagonal stroke → Social signal
•	Rounded frame → Transparency & integrity
Use cases:
•	App icon
•	Social media avatar
•	Favicon
•	Compact UI elements
•	Buttons, badges, or small tags
The symbol can be used alone when the brand is already clearly identified (app icon, social profiles, favicons) or when space is extremely limited.

1.3 Wordmark (NOORCHAIN)
The NOORCHAIN wordmark uses a custom geometric balance derived from Inter, adjusted to convey:
•	stability
•	precision
•	clarity
Do:
•	Use for titles, banners and hero visuals
•	Maintain the original letter spacing
•	Respect proportional spacing between symbol and wordmark
Don’t:
•	Do not stretch horizontally or vertically
•	Do not alter letter spacing
•	Do not rotate
•	Do not apply shadows, bevels or special effects
The wordmark must always appear clean, flat and solid.

1.4 Monochrome Versions
Monochrome versions guarantee visibility in low-color or constrained contexts.
Navy monochrome
•	For light backgrounds
•	For documents, reports, print materials
White monochrome
•	For dark backgrounds
•	For social media banners
•	For embossed or overlaid visuals
Rules:
•	Use monochrome only when full color is not appropriate
•	Never recolor the logo with non-brand tones
•	Do not mix a monochrome wordmark with a full-color icon

1.5 Safe Area & Minimum Size
Safe area (clear space)
The logo must always be surrounded by a protection zone equal to the height of the diagonal bar (the middle stroke of the N). No text or other graphic element should enter this zone.
Minimum display sizes:
Logo Type	Minimum Size
Icon (N-frame)	24 × 24 px
Full logo	120 px width
Wordmark only	80 px width
Below these sizes, legibility and brand recognition are compromised.

1.6 Incorrect Usage
The following distortions are strictly forbidden, as they break brand consistency:
•	Changing stroke thickness
•	Altering the turquoise/blue colors
•	Adding effects, gradients or shadows
•	Using the inner N shape without the rounded frame
•	Rotating, mirroring or flipping the N-frame
•	Placing the logo over noisy or low-contrast images without enough padding
When in doubt, use a solid white or navy background.

1.7 App Icons & Favicon
App Icon
•	File: appicon.svg
•	Used for mobile apps, desktop shortcuts and launchers
Favicon
•	File: favicon.svg
•	Used in browser tabs and bookmarks
Both must be displayed on white or navy backgrounds only.

1.8 Recommended Backgrounds
Allowed:
•	White #FFFFFF
•	Navy #0C2D48
•	Hero gradient #1A6AFF → #00D1B2
•	Neutral light surfaces
Avoid:
•	Red, yellow or orange backgrounds
•	High-noise textures or photos
•	Very light blue backgrounds with low contrast
The logo should always appear crisp and clearly separated from the background.

1.9 Official File Set
Approved master files:
File Name	Description
logo-full.svg	Primary full logo
logo-main.svg	Wordmark only
logo-icon.svg	Symbol (N-frame) only

3. TYPOGRAPHY
3.1 Typographic Philosophy
NOORCHAIN’s typography reflects:
•	transparency
•	precision
•	human-centered design
•	Swiss-inspired clarity
The system is intentionally minimalist and highly legible in both digital and printed formats.
The chosen font family is Inter, an open-source typeface designed for optimal readability and geometric consistency.

3.2 Primary Typeface: Inter
•	Family: Inter
•	Designer: Rasmus Andersson
•	Style: Geometric neo-grotesk
•	Traits: Clear, neutral, flexible, excellent legibility at small sizes
Approved weights:
•	Inter Light (300) — long text, extended reading
•	Inter Regular (400) — body text, UI elements
•	Inter Medium (500) — labels, captions
•	Inter SemiBold (600) — small titles, navigation
•	Inter Bold (700) — main titles, hero headlines

3.3 Hierarchy Rules (Headings & Body Text)
A consistent typographic hierarchy ensures cohesion across website, apps and documents.
H1 — Main titles
•	Weight: Bold (700)
•	Size: 48–72 px (web hero), 32–48 px (documents)
•	Letter-spacing: –1% to –2%
•	Color: Navy #0C2D48
H2 — Section titles
•	Weight: SemiBold (600)
•	Size: 28–36 px
•	Letter-spacing: 0%
•	Color: Navy
H3 — Subtitles / feature titles
•	Weight: Medium (500)
•	Size: 20–26 px
•	Color: Neutral Dark #3D4852
Body text (paragraphs)
•	Weight: Regular (400)
•	Size: 16–18 px
•	Line height: 140–160%
•	Color: Neutral Dark #3D4852

•	Use center alignment only for hero sections or short statements
•	Avoid full justification
•	Maintain a consistent vertical rhythm (24–32 px spacing between blocks)

3.5 Line Length Rules
Recommended characters per line:
Context	Characters per Line
Website paragraphs	55–75
Large desktop views	Up to 85

3.6 Typographic Restrictions
To protect brand integrity, avoid:
•	Serif typefaces
•	Rounded, playful or decorative fonts
•	Mixing Inter with random system fonts
•	Excessive letter spacing
•	Using Bold for large blocks of body text
•	Script or handwriting fonts
Consistency is a key driver of institutional credibility.

3.7 Typography in the Logo
The wordmark “NOORCHAIN” is not simple Inter text:
•	Based on Inter SemiBold
•	Custom horizontal spacing
•	Optical alignment tuned to match the N-frame icon
•	Slightly condensed letter spacing for a compact premium effect
It must never be recreated manually with standard Inter.

3.8 Accessibility Considerations
The typographic system is designed to respect WCAG standards:
•	Minimum contrast: 4.5:1 for body text
•	Large text contrast: ≥ 3:1
•	Minimum body size: 16 px
•	Line-height: ≥ 1.4
•	High readability on dark navy backgrounds

3.9 Use in PDF, Web & Mobile
Web
•	font-family: 'Inter', sans-serif;
•	Use variable font when possible for smoother transitions
PDF / Print
•	Embed Inter font files
•	Avoid simulated (faux) bold or italic
Mobile Apps
•	Use Inter consistently for all UI
•	Avoid fallback to system fonts to maintain visual identity

•	Logos and visual elements must not be altered or used for unrelated commercial products.
•	Attribution is required for academic or media usage where the logo appears in reports or studies.
•	Any commercial reuse (merchandise, co-branding, campaigns) requires prior written authorization from the NOORCHAIN project.

5. MOTION & INTERACTION GUIDELINES
5.1 Motion Philosophy
Motion in NOORCHAIN is not decorative.
It exists to support clarity, continuity and trust.
The role of motion is to:
•	guide attention,
•	structure reading flow,
•	suggest continuous activity,
•	reinforce a sense of operational seriousness.
Motion must always feel:
•	calm,
•	deliberate,
•	restrained,
•	institutional.
NOORCHAIN motion design follows a Swiss-inspired, engineering-first philosophy.
❌ Motion must never be:
•	playful,
•	flashy,
•	spectacular,
•	distracting,
•	or reminiscent of speculative Web3 aesthetics.

5.2 General Motion Principles
All motion within NOORCHAIN interfaces must comply with the following principles:
•	Purpose-driven
Every animation must have a functional reason (orientation, feedback, hierarchy).
•	Subtle by default
Motion should be felt more than noticed.
•	Consistent across platforms
Website, applications and digital assets must follow the same motion logic.
•	Performance-aware
Animations must not impact readability, loading time or device performance.

5.3 Section Entrance Animations (Scroll Reveal)
Section-level entrance animations are allowed and recommended to avoid static layouts.
Approved patterns
•	Opacity: 0 → 1
•	Vertical offset: +10 px to +24 px → 0
•	Duration: 300–500 ms
•	Easing: ease-out or soft cubic-bezier
Usage rules
•	Triggered on scroll (first appearance only)
•	No repeated looping
•	No staggered chaos; spacing must remain readable
Forbidden
•	Bounce or elastic effects
•	Horizontal slide-ins
•	Zoom-in or scale-based reveals
•	Long delays or cinematic sequencing
The objective is to create rhythm, not spectacle.

5.4 Micro-Interactions (UI Feedback)
Micro-interactions are essential to convey precision and responsiveness.
Buttons and links
Approved interactions:
•	Subtle vertical movement (1–2 px)
•	Light glow or contrast enhancement
•	Smooth transition (150–250 ms)
Hover and focus states must feel:
•	controlled,
•	confident,
•	immediate.
Forbidden
•	Color explosions
•	Shadows with large blur radius
•	Sound effects
•	Excessive easing or delays
Micro-interactions should communicate:
“This interface is alive, stable and intentional.”

5.5 Hero & Background Motion
Hero sections may include restrained background motion to avoid a frozen appearance.
Allowed
•	Slowly animated gradients
•	Very subtle noise textures
•	Soft glow on the N-frame or key elements
•	Long-duration, low-amplitude motion loops
Forbidden
•	Autoplay video backgrounds
•	Particle systems
•	WebGL-heavy effects
•	Fast or distracting movement
Hero motion should suggest:
continuity and depth, not excitement.

5.6 Accessibility & Reduced Motion
NOORCHAIN respects accessibility and user comfort.
Mandatory rules:
•	Honor prefers-reduced-motion
•	Provide static fallbacks when motion is disabled
•	Ensure no animation blocks content visibility
•	Maintain WCAG contrast and readability at all times
Motion must never be required to understand content.

5.7 Performance & Technical Constraints
•	Animations must remain lightweight
•	Avoid layout shifts
•	Avoid blocking JavaScript on load
•	Prefer CSS or minimal JS-based motion
•	Maintain smooth rendering on low-end devices
Performance degradation is considered a brand violation.

5.8 Motion Do / Don’t Summary
✔ Do
•	Use motion to guide reading
•	Keep durations short and calm
•	Maintain consistency
•	Prioritize clarity and trust
✘ Don’t
•	Use motion for decoration
•	Mimic crypto trading platforms
•	Add unnecessary visual noise
•	Sacrifice performance for effect

5.9 Brand Integrity Statement
Motion is part of NOORCHAIN’s visual identity.
Poor or excessive animation weakens institutional credibility.
When in doubt:
Remove motion rather than exaggerate it.
Clarity always prevails.
