NOORCHAIN Genesis Allocation 1.1

Genesis Pack
Version 1.1 — Last Updated: 10.12.2025

1. Purpose of This Document
This document defines the immutable genesis allocation of the NOORCHAIN native token NUR.
It is part of the official Genesis Pack 1.1 and serves as:
a regulatory reference (Swiss Legal Light CH),
an institutional document for partners and curators,
a technical source for the genesis configuration of the sovereign NOORCHAIN 2.1 L1 (EVM),
a public transparency guarantee.
No governance mechanism, Foundation decision, multisig execution, upgrade, or protocol change may modify these allocations.
2. Total Supply (Immutable)
The total supply of NOORCHAIN at genesis is:
299,792,458 NUR
(symbolic reference to the speed of light: 299,792,458 m/s)
This supply:
is fixed forever,
cannot be increased,
cannot be modified by governance,
defines the maximum issuance capacity of the protocol across all future PoSS eras and halving cycles.
3. Allocation Model (Immutable)
The genesis distribution follows the permanent 5 / 5 / 5 / 5 / 80 structure:
Allocation Pool | Percentage | Amount (NUR) | Description
Foundation Reserve | 5% | 14,989,622.9 | Governance, audits, public infrastructure, transparency
Noor Dev Sàrl | 5% | 14,989,622.9 | Engineering, integrations, infrastructure, tooling
PoSS Stimulus | 5% | 14,989,622.9 | Early onboarding for NGOs, schools, curator networks
Pre-sale Pool (Optional) | 5% | 14,989,622.9 | Strictly private, Swiss-compliant pre-mainnet financing
PoSS Mintable Reserve | 80% | 239,833,966.4 | Long-term PoSS issuance through halving
Rounding differences are accepted. Exact values are encoded in the genesis file.
4. Allocation Rules & Restrictions
4.1 Immutable Allocation
The 5 / 5 / 5 / 5 / 80 model is a permanent, protocol-level rule.
It cannot be changed by:
governance,
Foundation Board,
multisig,
smart contracts,
upgrades, forks, or parameter changes.
4.2 No Reallocation Between Pools
Tokens assigned to a pool must never be:
transferred to another pool,
merged or reduced,
repurposed,
used as financial guarantees,
pledged or collateralized.
Each pool has a strict mission and must remain isolated.
4.3 No Additional Minting
There is zero inflation.
Only the PoSS Mintable Reserve may introduce tokens into circulation — and only through the PoSS issuance rules and the halving schedule defined by the protocol.
Clarification (NOORCHAIN 2.1 architecture):
PoSS is an application-layer mechanism and does not participate in consensus.
Issuance constraints are enforced at the protocol level and remain fully independent from any financial narrative (no staking, no yield, no APR/APY posture).
No module, smart contract, or governance vote may mint tokens outside the PoSS issuance perimeter defined at genesis.
5. Description of Each Allocation Pool
5.1 Foundation Reserve — 5%
This pool supports:
governance operations,
legal and compliance work,
audits and security reviews,
documentation and transparency obligations,
institutional partnerships and public-good stewardship,
non-commercial mission execution.
Access requires:
multisig 3/5 approval,
compliance verification against Legal Light CH boundaries,
public reporting and traceable records.
The Foundation must not use this pool for:
market-making,
liquidity provision,
buybacks,
financial engineering,
any activity framed as a promise of return.
5.2 Noor Dev Sàrl (Development) — 5%
This pool supports:
protocol engineering and maintenance,
tooling and integrations,
infrastructure operations (nodes, monitoring, deployments),
research and long-term technical work,
institutional delivery of ecosystem components (dApps, interfaces, documentation portals).
All operations must follow Swiss corporate governance and accounting standards.
This allocation does not grant authority to modify:
token supply,
allocation percentages,
PoSS structural rules,
Legal Light compliance boundaries.
5.3 PoSS Stimulus Pool — 5%
This pool supports:
onboarding of NGOs and educational partners,
activation of early curator networks,
controlled pilots and institutional rollouts,
training, documentation, and operational enablement for curators,
non-financial participation programs aligned with the PoSS mission.
These funds are designed to accelerate adoption without creating financial incentives or speculative dynamics.
5.4 Pre-sale Pool (Optional) — 5%
This pool is:
strictly private,
Swiss-compliant and documentation-driven,
subject to clear vesting policies (recommended 6 + 18 months),
controlled by multisig execution and transparent governance records,
never open to the general public.
Clarification (Legal Light CH):
This pool does not constitute a public sale, ICO, token offering, or investment product.
Any proceeds, if any, are received exclusively by Noor Dev Sàrl, not by the Foundation.
Any communication must avoid:
investment framing,
performance claims,
return expectations.
5.5 PoSS Mintable Reserve — 80%
This pool is the core reserve powering the NOORCHAIN participation economy.
It is released into circulation exclusively through:
PoSS signal validation,
curator-authorised issuance events,
weighted social signals,
a protocol-defined halving cycle every 8 years,
strict daily limits and anti-abuse controls.
Duration:
Expected multi-decade issuance depending on adoption and usage.
This is a technical sustainability estimate, not a financial projection or guarantee.
The PoSS Mintable Reserve may not be:
diverted to other pools,
used for discretionary grants outside PoSS rules,
used for liquidity, staking, or yield systems,
accessed by any entity outside the PoSS issuance perimeter.
6. Addresses for Genesis (Phase 7)
The actual addresses for:
Foundation,
Noor Dev Sàrl,
PoSS Stimulus,
Pre-sale Pool,
PoSS Mintable Reserve
will be inserted during Phase 7 — Pre-Mainnet, once:
the five real addresses are generated,
ownership and multisig controls are verified,
they are synchronised across all canonical artifacts:
genesis configuration,
allocation registry,
governance and compliance documents,
public documentation references.
Until Phase 7, this section remains a placeholder.
7. Governance Limits
Governance cannot:
alter total supply,
change allocation percentages,
mint outside the PoSS issuance perimeter,
extend or repurpose the PoSS Mintable Reserve,
reassign or merge pools,
operate liquidity tools,
create financial products,
introduce staking, yield, or APR/APY dynamics.
Governance can adjust PoSS operational parameters only, within strict boundaries, without modifying:
the 5 / 5 / 5 / 5 / 80 structure,
the non-financial posture,
the application-layer separation of PoSS from consensus.
8. Integration in Genesis Pack
This Allocation Document is used to generate and verify:
the genesis allocation definition (supply and pool boundaries),
the institutional reserve structure and governance constraints,
the PoSS reserve issuance perimeter (as defined at genesis),
the public transparency references across the documentation suite.
It is also integrated into:
Public Whitepaper 1.1,
Tokenomics Public 1.1,
Compliance Framework,
Legal Notices & Disclaimers,
the public Documentation Hub (Phase 6.6).
9. Summary Table
Pool | Percentage | Notes
Foundation | 5% | Governance, audits, documentation, transparency
Noor Dev Sàrl | 5% | Engineering, infrastructure, integrations
PoSS Stimulus | 5% | NGOs, schools, curator onboarding, controlled programs
Pre-sale (Optional) | 5% | Private, Swiss-compliant, vested, non-public
PoSS Mintable Reserve | 80% | PoSS issuance reserve, halving-based, rules-only
Total = 100% (immutable)
10. Hierarchy of Governing Documents
