NOORCHAIN Economic Model 2.1

NOORCHAIN 2.1 — Economic Model
Version 2.1 
Last Updated: 03.12.2025

1. Core Economic Principles
1.1 Fixed Total Supply (Immutable)
Total supply is permanently capped at 299,792,458 NUR, a symbolic reference to the speed of light.
The supply cap is an invariant. It is not subject to governance, multisig action, protocol upgrade, or discretionary issuance.
No tokens may be created outside of the predefined PoSS reserve distribution rules described in this document.

1.2 Utility Token (Non-Financial)
NUR is a utility token designed to support protocol usage and access to the NOORCHAIN ecosystem.
NUR is used for:
• network fees (gas) and base protocol operations
• interaction with NOORCHAIN applications (e.g., Curators Hub and related social-utility dApps)
• PoSS-related actions and verification flows (application layer)
• governance interactions under a restricted, non-financial perimeter
• access to tooling and ecosystem services
NUR carries no equity, no dividend rights, no repayment claim, no redemption guarantee, and no yield promise.
NUR is not marketed as an investment instrument and must not be positioned through performance narratives, APR/APY language, or return expectations.

1.3 Sovereign L1 Architecture (Consensus vs. PoSS)
NOORCHAIN 2.1 is a sovereign EVM Layer-1 blockchain. It is not an Ethereum L2 and is not dependent on Ethereum mainnet for security or settlement.
Consensus is implemented as a permissioned BFT validator system designed to provide “mainnet-like” operational security and deterministic block production.
PoSS (Proof of Signal Social) is not consensus. PoSS is an application-layer mechanism that recognises verified human contribution through curator validation and published rules.
The separation is strict and intentional:
• Consensus provides security, ordering, and finality.
• PoSS provides social governance and social distribution logic without affecting consensus integrity.

1.4 Swiss Legal Light CH Compliance Perimeter
The economic model enforces a conservative compliance posture designed for Swiss Legal Light CH alignment.
The compliance perimeter includes:
• non-custodial architecture (users remain self-custodial)
• no promised returns and no yield framing
• no protocol-level “interest-like” mechanics
• no internal on/off-ramp operations (external PSPs only where applicable)
• transparent documentation and public constraints
• separation of roles between Foundation governance and the Development Entity (Sàrl)
• no public investment solicitation in protocol documentation
NOORCHAIN documentation must remain utility- and mission-focused, avoiding speculative or financial-product framing.

1.5 Curators as Structural Actors (PoSS Layer)
Curators are structural actors in the PoSS layer. They validate PoSS signals according to published guidelines and an ethical charter.
Curators receive a fixed share of PoSS distributions (30%) as defined in the PoSS structural split (see Section 3).
Curators do not control consensus, do not operate treasury functions by default, and do not receive discretionary protocol privileges.

2. Genesis Economic Allocation (Immutable)
The genesis distribution follows a permanent rule: 5 / 5 / 5 / 5 / 80.
Allocation Pool | Percentage | Description
Foundation Reserve | 5% | Governance, transparency, public-good operations
Development Entity (Sàrl) | 5% | Development, integrations, infrastructure, R&D
PoSS Stimulus Pool | 5% | Early support for NGOs, schools, associations, curator onboarding
Pre-sale Pool | 5% | Optional, vested, private-only, Swiss-compliant fundraising perimeter
PoSS Mintable Reserve | 80% | Long-term PoSS issuance through halving-defined distribution
These percentages are immutable. They cannot be modified after network launch.
Exact amounts are encoded in the genesis configuration. Minor rounding differences in public tables do not alter the immutable percentage model.

2.1 Legal and Governance Constraints (Allocation)
The allocation model is protected by non-negotiable constraints:
• percentages are immutable
• no reallocation between pools is permitted
• pools must not be pledged, collateralized, or engineered into financial products
• no new tokens may ever be created outside the PoSS reserve distribution path
• the Foundation must not operate financial services or custodial activities
Pre-sale constraints (if activated):
• strictly private and Swiss-compliant perimeter
• mandatory vesting and transparent terms
• no public offering posture
Funds raised from any private pre-sale activity are received exclusively by the Development Entity (Sàrl), never by the Foundation.
The Pre-sale Pool does not represent an ICO, a public token sale, or an investment product.

3. PoSS Rewards Economic Model (Application Layer)
PoSS distributes NUR based on verified positive social actions validated by curators. PoSS is an application-layer mechanism that operates independently from consensus.
PoSS is designed to be non-financial in posture: it is not staking, not mining, not interest, and not a yield product.
All PoSS distributions originate exclusively from the PoSS Mintable Reserve.
3.1 Reward Split (Immutable)
Hard-coded structural rule:
• 70% → Participant
• 30% → Curator
This structural split is immutable and cannot be changed by governance, upgrades, multisig operations, or parameter adjustments.

3.2 Halving Schedule (8-Year Period, Immutable)
Every 8 years, base PoSS rewards are reduced by half according to protocol-defined rules.
This is a deterministic technical mechanism designed for long-term sustainability. It is not a financial forecast and must not be presented as such.

3.3 Daily Limits (Governance Adjustable Within Boundaries)
PoSS includes limits to prevent abuse and farming dynamics, including:
• maximum signals per participant per day
• maximum validations per curator per day
• maximum rewards per participant per day
• maximum rewards per curator per day
Governance may adjust these operational parameters within a restricted perimeter.
Governance cannot alter the structural split (70/30), total supply, or the halving period.

3.4 Non-Financial Positioning (Mandatory)
PoSS rewards are:
• symbolic in posture
• capped by design
• traceable on-chain
• independent of market performance
• prohibited from being promoted as salary, income, interest, or yield
PoSS must be communicated as recognition of validated contribution, not financial compensation.

4. Long-Term Emission Timeline (Non-Inflationary)
The PoSS reserve is designed for multi-era distribution whose longevity depends on real usage and configured caps.
Approximate halving-defined eras:
• Era 1 (Years 1–8): base distribution level
• Era 2 (Years 9–16): 50% of Era 1
• Era 3 (Years 17–24): 25% of Era 1
• Era 4 (Years 25–32): 12.5% of Era 1
• Long tail: continued reductions every 8 years
This timeline is a technical description of distribution mechanics, not a promise of duration or economic outcome.
The key invariant remains: there is no inflation. All distributed tokens originate from the single, predefined PoSS reserve established at genesis.

5. Market Model (Allowed vs. Forbidden)
NOORCHAIN adopts a conservative market posture aligned with Swiss Legal Light constraints. Market access may exist, but the protocol and its governance bodies must not operate financial-market functions.

5.1 Allowed
• orderbook exchange listings (e.g., centralized venues operating orderbooks)
• free-market trading by independent actors
• utility-driven demand through applications and network usage
• external PSP integrations where applicable (operated by regulated third parties, not by NOORCHAIN)
• public grants and non-financial partnership funding
• institutional partnerships and pilots
• revenue generation by the Development Entity (Sàrl) through services (e.g., SaaS, integrations), not through protocol-level financial engineering

5.2 Forbidden
• yield farming and yield-based narratives
• APR/APY staking return products positioned as passive income
• Foundation-operated liquidity pools
• market-making by the Foundation
• token price guarantees or performance claims
• investment promotion or public solicitation framed as financial opportunity
• custodial services operated by NOORCHAIN governance bodies
• buyback programs presented as economic return mechanisms

6. Sustainability and Governance Model
The economic architecture is designed to be stable, auditable, and institution-compatible across multiple decades.
Key safeguards include:
• zero inflation and fixed supply
• immutable allocation model (5 / 5 / 5 / 5 / 80)
• strict separation between Foundation governance and the Development Entity (Sàrl)
• PoSS as a non-consensus, non-financial application layer
• transparent constraints and documentation-first governance boundaries
Governance is permitted to adjust operational parameters where explicitly allowed, but cannot modify the protocol’s economic invariants.

7. Founder Compensation (Transparent, Constrained)
NOORCHAIN adopts a conservative posture regarding leadership compensation and token handling.
The founder’s economic exposure is structurally limited to:
• the Development Entity (Sàrl) allocation (5%), subject to transparent vesting and corporate governance
• non-token grants or service revenues where applicable and compliant
• optional secondary-market access through independent orderbooks, without any guarantee of liquidity or price
The founder and leadership:
• have no access to Foundation funds
• cannot modify supply or economic invariants
• must not engage in market manipulation narratives or actions
A conservative disclosure policy may include a recommended sale ceiling (e.g., ≤ 0.5% per month of Sàrl-held liquid tokens), subject to governance ethics and transparency constraints.

8. Summary
NOORCHAIN 2.1’s economic model is:
• fixed in supply
• transparent in rules
• non-inflationary by design
• utility-driven and non-financial in posture
• governed under strict immutable boundaries
• compatible with a conservative Swiss Legal Light CH framework
• structured for multi-era sustainability through PoSS halving mechanics
This document is part of the NOORCHAIN public documentation set and is intended to remain stable. It may be updated only for clarification and alignment with governance-approved operational parameter changes that do not affect economic invariants.
