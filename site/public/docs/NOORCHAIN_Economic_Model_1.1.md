NOORCHAIN 1.0 — Economic Model
Version 1.1 
Last Updated: 03.12.2025

1. Core Economic Principles

NOORCHAIN operates on a transparent, non-inflationary and Swiss-compliant economic model.

1.1 Fixed Total Supply (Immutable)

Total supply is permanently capped at 299,792,458 NUR, symbolic reference to the speed of light.
No minting is allowed outside PoSS reserve mechanics.

1.2 Utility Token (Non-Financial)

NUR is strictly a utility token, used for:

PoSS participation

NOORCHAIN dApps (NOOR Pay, Curators Hub, CCN Studio)

Curator validation

Governance interactions (non-financial)

Access to ecosystem tools

NUR carries no financial rights, no yield, no dividends, no equity, and no redemption value.

1.3 Hybrid Consensus Architecture

Cosmos SDK + Ethermint (EVM)

PoSS (Proof of Signal Social) as a human-centric, non-financial reward mechanism

PoSS is not mining, not staking, and not a yield product.

1.4 Swiss Legal Light CH Compliance

The economic model enforces:

no custody

no promised returns

no APR/APY/staking yield

no financial promotion

external PSPs only (e.g., Mt Pelerin, NOWPayments)

transparent governance

no public investment solicitation

1.5 Curators as Structural Actors

Curators validate PoSS signals and receive 30% of each distributed reward.

2. Genesis Economic Allocation (Immutable)

Permanent rule: 5 / 5 / 5 / 5 / 80.

Allocation Pool	Percentage	Description
Foundation Reserve	5%	Governance, transparency, public-good operations
Noor Dev Sàrl	5%	Development, integrations, infrastructure, R&D
PoSS Stimulus Pool	5%	Early support for NGOs, schools, associations
Pre-sale Pool	5%	Optional, fully vested, Swiss-only private allocation
PoSS Mintable Reserve	80%	Long-term PoSS technical emission
2.1 Legal and Governance Constraints

Percentages are immutable

No reallocation allowed

No new tokens may ever be minted

Pools cannot be collateralized or pledged

Pre-sale is strictly private and non-investment

Funds from the Pre-sale Pool are received exclusively by Noor Dev Sàrl, never by the Foundation.

The Pre-sale Pool does not represent an ICO, public token sale, or financial product.

3. PoSS Rewards Economic Model

PoSS distributes tokens ethically, based on validated positive social actions.

3.1 Reward Split (Immutable)

Hard-coded rule:

70% → Participant

30% → Curator

This cannot be changed by governance.

3.2 Halving Schedule

Every 8 years, raw PoSS rewards are reduced by half.

This is a protocol mechanism, not a financial forecast.

3.3 Daily Limits (Governance Adjustable)

Limits exist to prevent abuse:

max signals per participant

max signals per curator

max reward per participant

max reward per curator

Governance may adjust these except the 70/30 split.

3.4 Non-Financial Positioning

PoSS rewards are:

symbolic

capped

predictable

transparent

independent of market performance

never promoted as income

They represent social acknowledgment, not financial compensation.

4. Long-Term Emission Timeline (Non-Inflationary)

The PoSS reserve is designed for multi-era technical emission, depending on activity.

Approximate protocol schedule:

Era 1 (Years 1–8): initial emission

Era 2 (Years 9–16): 50% of Era 1

Era 3 (Years 17–24): 25% of Era 1

Era 4 (Years 25–32): 12.5% of Era 1

After each halving, PoSS issuance decreases predictably.

These timelines are technical projections, not financial expectations.

5. Market Model (Allowed vs Forbidden)

6. Sustainability & Governance Model

The NOORCHAIN economic architecture guarantees:

zero inflation

multi-era operational stability

strict separation Foundation / Sàrl

fair distribution

transparent governance

long-term ethical alignment

7. Founder Compensation (Transparent, Regulated)

The founder’s economic role follows strict legal and governance rules:

5% Dev Sàrl allocation (vested)

access to optional grants (non-token)

potential market exit via orderbook, without guarantee of liquidity

no access to Foundation funds

recommended maximum sale rate: ≤ 0.5% per month

This model ensures Swiss-aligned transparency, neutrality, and sustainability.
