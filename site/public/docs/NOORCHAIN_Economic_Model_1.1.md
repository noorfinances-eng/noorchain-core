NOORCHAIN 1.0 — Economic Model
Phase 3 — Official Specification
Version 1.1 (Omega Clean)
Last Updated: 2025-12-03
________________________________________
1. Core Economic Principles
NOORCHAIN operates on a transparent, non-inflationary and Swiss-compliant economic model.
Its foundation relies on the following principles:
1.1 Fixed Total Supply (Immutable)
Total supply is permanently capped at 299,792,458 NUR, a symbolic reference to the speed of light.
No further minting is ever allowed outside PoSS reserve mechanics.
1.2 Utility Token (Non-Financial)
NUR is strictly a utility token, used for:
•	PoSS participation
•	NOORCHAIN dApps (NOOR Pay, Curators Hub, CCN Studio)
•	Curator validation
•	Governance interactions (non-financial)
•	Access to ecosystem tools
It is not designed as an investment, yield, or speculative asset.
1.3 Hybrid Consensus Architecture
•	Cosmos SDK + Ethermint (EVM) for security and modularity
•	PoSS – Proof of Signal Social as a human-centric reward layer
PoSS is not mining, not staking, and not a yield product.
1.4 Swiss Legal Light CH Compliance
The model enforces:
•	no custody of user funds
•	no promised returns
•	no APR / APY / staking yield
•	no financial promotion
•	no internal fiat conversion
•	external PSPs only (e.g., Mt Pelerin, NOWPayments)
•	full transparency and reporting
1.5 Curators as Structural Actors
Curators validate PoSS signals and receive 30% of each distributed reward.

2. Genesis Economic Allocation (Immutable)
The entire supply follows the permanent 5 / 5 / 5 / 5 / 80 rule.
Allocation Pool	Percentage	Description
Foundation Reserve	5%	Governance, transparency, public-good operations
Noor Dev Sàrl	5%	Development, integrations, infrastructure, R&D
PoSS Stimulus Pool	5%	Early support for NGOs, schools, associations
Pre-sale Pool	5%	Optional, fully vested, Swiss investors only
PoSS Mintable Reserve	80%	Long-term PoSS issuance over decades
2.1 Legal and Governance Constraints
•	Percentages are immutable.
•	No reallocation between pools is allowed.
•	No new tokens may ever be minted.
•	Pre-sale usage requires:
o	strict vesting
o	multi-sig approval
o	Swiss investor qualification
•	Economic model must remain fully non-investment.

3. PoSS Rewards Economic Model
PoSS distributes tokens fairly and ethically, based on validated positive actions.
3.1 Reward Split (Immutable)
This structural rule is hard-coded:
•	70% → Participant
•	30% → Curator
It cannot be changed by governance.
3.2 Halving Schedule
Every 8 years, raw PoSS rewards are reduced by half.
This ensures long-term sustainability and aligns with multi-decade planning.
3.3 Daily Limits (Governance-Adjustable)
To prevent farming and abuse:
•	Maximum signals per participant per day
•	Maximum signals per curator per day
•	Maximum reward per participant per day
•	Maximum reward per curator per day
Governance may adjust these parameters except the 70/30 split.
3.4 Non-Financial Positioning
PoSS rewards are:
•	symbolic
•	capped
•	predictable
•	transparent
•	not linked to market performance
•	never marketed as income
They strictly comply with Swiss FINMA expectations.

4. Long-Term Emission Timeline (Non-Inflationary)
The 80% PoSS reserve is designed to last 25–40 years, depending on adoption.
Approximate schedule:
•	Years 1–8: initial emission era
•	Years 9–16: 50% reduction
•	Years 17–24: 25% of original era
•	Years 25–32: 12.5% of original era
After each halving cycle, raw PoSS rewards decrease accordingly.

7. Founder Compensation (Transparent, Regulated)
The founder’s economic role follows strict governance rules:
