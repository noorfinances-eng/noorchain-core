NOORCHAIN FOUNDATION — Genesis Governance
Phase 5 — C3
Version 1.1
Last Updated: 2025-XX-XX
________________________________________
1. Purpose of Genesis Governance
This document defines the initial governance configuration embedded in the
Mainnet Genesis Block (“genesis.json”).
It ensures:
•	transparent initial allocations,
•	clearly defined governance responsibilities,
•	alignment with the Swiss Legal Light CH framework,
•	mission-oriented distribution of early resources,
•	correct initialization of PoSS parameters,
•	proper mapping of institutional addresses,
•	and immutability of core governance principles.
Genesis Governance is the backbone of NOORCHAIN’s legitimacy, safety, and long-term stability.
________________________________________
2. Immutable Genesis Principles
The following principles are permanently embedded and cannot be altered post-launch:
1.	Fixed Supply
Total cap = 299,792,458 NUR (symbolic “speed of light” supply).
2.	Halving Every 8 Years
PoSS issuance decreases on a predictable, long-term schedule.
3.	No Inflation Beyond PoSS Reserve
No discretionary minting is permitted.
4.	5/5/5/5/80 Allocation Model
o	5% Foundation
o	5% Noor Dev Sàrl (functional allocation)
o	5% PoSS Stimulus
o	5% Pre-sale (optional, vesting mandatory)
o	80% PoSS Mintable Reserve
5.	PoSS Reward Split (Immutable)
o	70% Participant
o	30% Curator
6.	No Custody
The Foundation cannot hold or manage user funds.
7.	Non-Investment Token
Governance cannot transform NUR into a yield-bearing or financial product.
8.	Legal Light CH Compatibility
All genesis rules follow Swiss non-profit, non-custodial, non-speculative requirements.
________________________________________
3. Genesis Addresses (To Be Finalized in Phase 7)
The following placeholder addresses will be replaced with real bech32 addresses in Phase 7.
3.1 Foundation Address
noor1foundationxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Purpose: Holds 5% supply, controlled exclusively via 3/5 multi-sig.
3.2 Noor Dev Sàrl Address
noor1devsarlxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Purpose: Receives the 5% functional allocation.
3.3 PoSS Stimulus Reserve
noor1stimulusxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Purpose: Early ecosystem support (NGOs, schools, pilots).
3.4 Pre-sale Optional Pool
noor1presalexxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Purpose: 5% supply, locked until governance + legal approval.
3.5 PoSS Mintable Reserve (80%)
noor1possreservexxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Purpose: Main PoSS issuance pool, minted via PoSS rules only.

4. Genesis Allocations (Hard-Coded)
4.1 Summary Table
Category	Percentage	Supply (NUR)
Foundation	5%	14,989,623
Noor Dev Sàrl	5%	14,989,623
PoSS Stimulus	5%	14,989,623
Pre-sale Optional	5%	14,989,623
PoSS Mintable Reserve	80%	239,833,984
Total	100%	299,792,458
These allocations are immutable and encoded directly in genesis.json.

5. Genesis Governance Powers
At genesis, governance authority is distributed across the following entities:
5.1 Foundation Board
•	Approves administrative actions
•	Oversees documentation and mission integrity
•	Supervises Curators
•	Publishes transparency and annual reports
5.2 Multi-sig Committee (3/5)
•	Executes all on-chain Foundation actions
•	Controls the Foundation Address
•	Adjusts PoSS parameters (within legal + governance constraints)
•	May pause PoSS in emergencies
•	Approves deployment of new modules
5.3 Noor Dev Sàrl
•	No inherent governance power
•	Holds the 5% functional allocation
•	Contributes technical proposals
•	May submit governance proposals
5.4 Curators
•	No binding governance power at genesis
•	Provide advisory input
•	Form the basis for future decentralized governance models

6. Genesis Parameters (PoSS & Core Protocol)
6.1 Initial PoSS Parameters
Adjustable by governance after launch (except immutable structural rules):
•	PoSSEnabled: false
•	BaseReward: 1 unur
•	WeightMicroDonation: 2
•	WeightParticipation: 1
•	WeightContent: 3
•	WeightCCN: 4
•	MaxSignalsPerDay: 10
•	MaxSignalsPerCuratorPerDay: 20
•	MaxRewardPerDay: 100 unur
•	HalvingPeriodYears: 8
6.2 Economic Constraints
•	Minting cannot exceed the 80% PoSS reserve
•	No external minting
•	No discretionary creation of new pools
________________________________________
7. Governance Limits (Hard-Coded)
The following rules cannot be changed through governance:
1.	Fixed total supply
2.	PoSS structural split (70/30)
3.	Prohibition of inflation
4.	Genesis allocation percentages
5.	Legal Light CH restrictions
6.	Genesis addresses cannot be reassigned without full governance quorum
________________________________________
8. Post-Genesis Upgrade Path
Future governance extensions may include:
1.	Activation of PoSS after the stability period
2.	Addition of new Curators
3.	Adjustment of PoSS limits and weights
4.	Deployment of ecosystem modules (Hub, Studio, Pay)
5.	Enhanced governance mechanisms
6.	Expansion or rotation of multi-sig signers
7.	Introduction of Curator advisory voting
________________________________________
9. Documentation Requirements
Before or at mainnet launch, the following documents must be published:
•	Governance Charter (C2)
•	Multi-sig Committee Charter (C1)
•	Legal Light PDF
•	Genesis Allocation PDF
•	Foundation Statutes
Collectively, these form the Genesis Governance Pack.
________________________________________
