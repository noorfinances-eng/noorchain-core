NOORCHAIN Genesis Governance 2.1

NOORCHAIN FOUNDATION — Genesis Governance
Version 2.1
Last Updated: 10.12.2025

1. Purpose of Genesis Governance
This document defines the initial governance configuration applied at NOORCHAIN 2.1 genesis.
It establishes:
transparent initial allocations and governance boundaries,
clear responsibilities between Foundation, Development Entity, and operational committees,
alignment with the Swiss Legal Light CH framework,
mission-oriented stewardship of early resources,
the structural separation PoSS ≠ consensus,
the initial mapping of institutional addresses,
immutability of core governance principles.
Genesis Governance is a constitutional layer of NOORCHAIN 2.1.
In case of conflict, the Foundation Statutes and Legal Architecture prevail.
2. Immutable Genesis Principles
The following principles are permanently embedded and cannot be altered post-launch:
2.1 Fixed Supply
Total cap = 299,792,458 NUR (symbolic “speed of light”).
2.2 Halving Every 8 Years (PoSS Issuance Rule)
PoSS issuance decreases according to protocol rules.
This is a technical rule, not a financial forecast.
2.3 No Inflation Beyond the PoSS Reserve
No discretionary minting is permitted.
All issuance must be rule-bound.
2.4 Immutable Genesis Allocation Model (5 / 5 / 5 / 5 / 80)
5% Foundation
5% Noor Dev Sàrl
5% PoSS Stimulus
5% Pre-sale (optional, vested, private only)
80% PoSS Mintable Reserve
2.5 PoSS Reward Split (Immutable)
70% participant
30% curator
2.6 PoSS ≠ Consensus (Structural Separation)
Consensus provides security and finality.
PoSS provides social recognition and governance signals.
PoSS must not alter consensus rules or validator security mechanics.
2.7 No Custody
Genesis governance cannot introduce custodial functions.
2.8 Non-Investment Posture
Governance cannot transform NUR into a financial or yield-bearing instrument.
2.9 Legal Light CH Compatibility
All governance rules must remain within Swiss non-custodial, non-speculative, non-yield boundaries.
3. Governance Architecture at Genesis (NOORCHAIN 2.1)
NOORCHAIN 2.1 operates as a sovereign EVM Layer-1 secured by a permissioned BFT validator set.
Governance at genesis is designed for institutional-grade safety and operational accountability.
3.1 Foundation Board (Strategic Stewardship)
The Foundation Board:
defines mission and governance doctrine,
approves governance policies and documentation,
oversees curator framework and institutional partnerships,
authorises transparency reports and compliance posture,
cannot execute unilateral on-chain actions outside approved procedures.
3.2 Multi-sig Committee (3/5) (On-Chain Execution Body)
The multi-sig committee:
executes on-chain actions for Foundation-controlled addresses,
controls the Foundation allocation and any governance execution keys,
implements governance-approved upgrades and parameter changes,
may trigger emergency-safe actions within strictly documented limits.
The multi-sig is an execution layer, not a discretionary policy-maker.
3.3 Development Entity (Noor Dev Sàrl) (Technical Operator)
The Development Entity:
holds the functional 5% allocation,
delivers protocol implementation and infrastructure operations,
may submit technical proposals and governance drafts,
has no authority to modify immutable rules or control Foundation assets.
3.4 Validator Operators (Permissioned BFT)
Validator operators:
secure the chain via permissioned BFT consensus,
are subject to documented operational requirements and accountability procedures,
do not receive protocol-defined yield or staking rewards by default,
operate under governance-approved participation terms compatible with Legal Light CH.
Validator governance is managed through documented procedures and multi-signature execution.
3.5 Curators (PoSS Validation Role)
Curators:
validate PoSS signals under published guidelines,
sign PoSS snapshots as defined by the PoSS mechanism,
receive 30% of PoSS-distributed rewards (structural rule),
hold no treasury authority and do not control consensus.
4. Genesis Addresses (To Be Finalised in Pre-Mainnet Phase)
Genesis addresses are institutional assignment points and governance anchors.
They do not function as custodial accounts and must not be presented as deposit destinations.
Placeholder addresses are replaced during the pre-mainnet finalisation phase with verified addresses under documented procedures.
4.1 Foundation Address
Purpose: holds the Foundation 5% allocation, controlled exclusively via 3/5 multi-sig.
4.2 Noor Dev Sàrl Address
Purpose: holds the Development Entity 5% functional allocation.
4.3 PoSS Stimulus Address
Purpose: holds the 5% stimulus pool for early onboarding and institutional activation.
4.4 Pre-sale Optional Pool Address
Purpose: holds the optional 5% reserve for strictly private, regulated, vested fundraising.
Clarification:
This does not represent a public offering, ICO, or investment product.
Any proceeds are received exclusively by Noor Dev Sàrl, not by the Foundation.
4.5 PoSS Mintable Reserve Address (80%)
Purpose: the protocol-controlled reserve for PoSS issuance only.
This reserve must not be used for discretionary transfers or non-PoSS distributions.
5. Genesis Allocations (Hard-Encoded)
Allocation amounts are embedded in the genesis configuration.
Rounding differences are acceptable at the document level; the authoritative source is the genesis file.
Category: Foundation
Percentage: 5%
Purpose: governance, audits, transparency, public stewardship
Category: Noor Dev Sàrl
Percentage: 5%
Purpose: development, infrastructure, tooling, operations
Category: PoSS Stimulus
Percentage: 5%
Purpose: onboarding, pilots, curator activation
Category: Pre-sale Optional
Percentage: 5%
Purpose: private, regulated, vested financing only
Category: PoSS Mintable Reserve
Percentage: 80%
Purpose: long-term PoSS issuance under halving and rule constraints
Total: 100% (immutable)
6. Genesis Governance Powers and Boundaries
6.1 Governance Powers (Allowed, Restricted)
Governance may:
approve protocol upgrades that preserve immutable constraints,
adjust operational parameters within documented limits,
define curator onboarding rules and policies,
approve emergency procedures consistent with Legal Light CH,
manage committee rotations and key governance processes.
6.2 Emergency Powers (Strictly Limited)
In a documented emergency, the multi-sig may:
temporarily disable PoSS execution paths if required for integrity protection,
pause specific non-consensus application functions,
initiate incident response measures.
Emergency actions must be:
time-bounded,
fully documented,
non-financial in posture,
auditable and published.
6.3 Non-Negotiable Boundaries
Governance cannot:
modify total supply,
change the 5 / 5 / 5 / 5 / 80 allocation model,
change the PoSS structural split (70/30),
change the halving period (8 years),
introduce discretionary minting,
operate custody or financial products,
create yield mechanisms (APR/APY posture),
reassign institutional pools outside defined governance processes,
merge pools, collateralise pools, or repurpose pools for financial engineering,
collapse the separation PoSS ≠ consensus.
7. PoSS Governance at Genesis (Application Layer)
7.1 Initial Posture
PoSS is an application-layer mechanism.
It must remain operationally and conceptually separate from consensus security.
7.2 Adjustable PoSS Parameters (Non-Structural)
Governance may adjust certain PoSS parameters within documented ranges, such as:
daily limits,
signal-type weights,
operational thresholds for curator policies,
non-structural safeguards.
Governance cannot modify structural PoSS invariants.
7.3 Economic Constraints
PoSS issuance cannot exceed the PoSS reserve.
No issuance outside PoSS rules is permitted.
8. Post-Genesis Upgrade Path (Governance-Compatible)
Possible future governance extensions include:
activation and scaling of PoSS after stability validation,
curator set expansion and institutional onboarding,
deployment of ecosystem application modules,
operational enhancements to transparency and audit tooling,
multi-sig rotation procedures,
validator set policy updates under permissioned BFT governance.
All extensions must remain compatible with Legal Light CH and immutable constraints.
9. Publication and Documentation Requirements
Before or at mainnet launch, the following must be published as public governance references:
Foundation Statutes
Legal Architecture
Legal Light Framework
Multisig Committee Charter
Genesis Pack (including Genesis Allocation and Genesis Parameters)
Legal Notices and Disclaimers
These documents collectively form the Genesis Governance documentation suite.
10. Adoption
This document is adopted by the NOORCHAIN Foundation Board and maintained as part of the NOORCHAIN 2.1 Genesis Pack public reference.
