1. Overview
What is NOORCHAIN?
NOORCHAIN is a Swiss, non-financial blockchain protocol designed to recognise positive human contribution through transparent, ethical, and verifiable digital signals.
It introduces PoSS — Proof of Social Signal, a mechanism that enables institutions to acknowledge real-world social participation such as education, volunteering, community engagement, and cultural involvement.
NOORCHAIN is designed as social infrastructure, not as a financial product.
It is built for:
•	NGOs and humanitarian organisations
•	Schools and universities
•	Municipalities and public institutions
•	Cultural organisations
•	Community and civic programs

2. Official Description (Short)
NOORCHAIN is a Swiss ethical blockchain designed to recognise positive human contribution through a transparent, non-financial mechanism called PoSS (Proof of Social Signal).
It provides institutions with a trusted, public-good digital infrastructure for social recognition.

3. Key Messages (Media & Institutional Use)
•	NOORCHAIN is non-financial and non-custodial.
•	Built within Swiss Legal-Light CH principles.
•	Zero yield, zero staking, zero investment mechanics.
•	Purpose: recognise social contribution, not capital.
•	Fixed and immutable supply of NUR tokens.
•	Long-term, multi-decade governance horizon.
•	Curators are institutions (NGOs, schools, cultural and civic bodies).
•	Designed for education, NGOs, municipalities, culture and communities.
•	Vision: establish a durable infrastructure for social contribution.

4. Important Technical Clarification
PoSS (Proof of Social Signal) is not a consensus mechanism and does not secure the blockchain.
Network security relies on a permissioned BFT consensus architecture.
PoSS operates strictly at the application layer for governance, coordination, and recognition of social contribution.
This separation is intentional and fundamental to the NOORCHAIN design.

5. Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)
NOORCHAIN is a blockchain designed to recognise real human participation rather than financial power.
Through PoSS — Proof of Social Signal — it enables institutions such as NGOs, schools, and municipalities to ethically validate participation, volunteering, and community engagement as transparent digital records.
NOORCHAIN is non-financial, non-custodial, and aligned with Swiss Legal-Light principles.
It introduces a new category of blockchain: social contribution infrastructure.

6. Mission Statement
To build a long-term, transparent, and ethical digital infrastructure that recognises positive human contribution at scale, without financial incentives, speculation, or investment mechanisms.

7. Vision
A global public-good protocol where:
•	participation is measurable,
•	social contribution is recognised,
•	institutions collaborate transparently,
•	and communities rely on a durable digital infrastructure for trust and coordination.
