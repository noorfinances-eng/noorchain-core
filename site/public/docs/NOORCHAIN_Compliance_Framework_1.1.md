Version 1.1
Last Updated: 10.12.2025

Legal Disclaimer 

This document provides a descriptive overview of NOORCHAIN’s Legal Light compliance model.
It does not constitute legal advice, financial advice, an investment prospectus, or an offer of securities.

NOORCHAIN does not custody user assets, does not guarantee returns, and does not provide any regulated financial service.

1. Purpose of the Compliance Framework

This document defines the complete compliance framework for the
NOORCHAIN ecosystem under the Swiss Legal Light CH classification.

It consolidates:

legal principles

operational limitations

governance duties

communication rules

disclaimers

PoSS compliance

risk management

transparency requirements

It applies to:

NOORCHAIN Foundation

Multi-sig Committee

Noor Dev Sàrl (functional allocation)

Curators

Technical contributors

Partners (NGO, education, social actors)

This document will be transformed into an official PDF during Phase 6.

2. Compliance Classification (Legal Light CH)

NOORCHAIN operates as:

A non-profit, non-custodial, non-investment blockchain project.

The Foundation:

does not custody user assets

does not offer financial products

does not guarantee returns

does not run payment services

does not provide exchange or conversion

NOORCHAIN is classified as a Utility Token protocol with social impact,
not a financial intermediary under Swiss law.

3. Compliance Principles (Permanent)

The following principles are immutable:

3.1 No Custody

The Foundation and multi-sig must never hold user funds or private keys.

3.2 No Promised Returns

NUR does not promise yield, interest, dividends, or appreciation.

3.3 No Investment Offering

NUR is not sold as a financial product.

3.4 Fixed Supply

Supply is capped at 299,792,458 NUR.

3.5 Transparency

All governance actions and use of funds must be publicly documented.

3.6 Open-Source & Ethical Mission

All development must follow ethical and open-source standards.

3.7 Non-Profit Alignment

Foundation resources must support public-benefit activities only.

4. Token Compliance

NUR is classified as a Utility Token because it:

enables validation of PoSS actions

powers dApps (Pay, Curators Hub, Studio)

rewards positive contributions

NUR is not:

a payment token with regulated fiat gateways

a security token

a stablecoin

an investment vehicle

No token is issued in exchange for capital investment.

5. PoSS Compliance (Proof of Signal Social)

PoSS is designed to be:

non-financial

ethical

socially beneficial

transparent

non-extractive

fully capped

Classification

PoSS is a social reward system, not a financial yield mechanism.

Restrictions

no deposits required

no lock-up

no APR/APY

no financial promise

reward = action × weight

halving every 8 years

hard-coded supply cap

All PoSS rewards come from the 80% PoSS Reserve, not from inflation.

6. Operational Restrictions

The Foundation may not:

manage wallets

hold user NUR

operate liquidity pools

manipulate the market

run exchange or PSP

guarantee prices

offer staking-as-a-service

accept investor funds directly (handled later via Noor Dev Sàrl)

These restrictions ensure strict Legal Light CH compatibility.

7. Risk Management
7.1 Technical Risks

bugs, exploits, network failures

mitigated by audits, code reviews, emergency procedures

7.2 Legal Risks

misinterpretation of PoSS or token purpose

regulatory changes

mitigated by clear documentation & transparency

7.3 User Risks

private key loss

phishing

scam attempts

mitigated through education and warnings

8. Governance Compliance
Foundation Board:

enforce Legal Light boundaries

publish annual reports

supervise Foundation allocation

maintain public transparency

Multi-sig Committee:

enforce strict 3/5 threshold

never custody user assets

publish biannual transparency reports

document all actions

Curators:

validate PoSS actions ethically

Noor Dev Sàrl:

no financial services

9. Reporting Obligations
Mandatory reports:

Biannual Multi-sig Report

Annual Financial Report

Security Incident Report (if needed)

All reports must be publicly accessible.

10. Communication Compliance (Corrected Section)

All communication must avoid:

price speculation

financial language

investment terminology

return expectations

misleading marketing

Allowed wording

“non-profit ecosystem”

“ethical blockchain”

“utility token”

“public-good mission”

“rewarding positive social actions”

Forbidden wording (NEW & strict)

“profit”, “invest”, “investment”, “ROI”, “APR”, “APY”, “earn money”, “make money”

“financial upside”, “price prediction”, “moon”, “guaranteed returns”

“your funds are safe with us” (custody implication — forbidden)

And the mandatory line:

PoSS rewards must never be described as financial compensation.

11. Partner Compliance (NGOs, Schools, Associations)

Partners must:

be transparent

validate PoSS actions ethically

avoid misuse of rewards

avoid any financial interpretation

Violations may result in suspension.

12. External PSP Compliance (strengthened)

Crypto–fiat conversions occur only through regulated external PSP partners.

The Foundation:

remains fully within Legal Light CH
