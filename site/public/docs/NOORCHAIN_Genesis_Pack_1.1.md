NOORCHAIN — GENESIS PACK 1.1
FULL OFFICIAL DOCUMENT 
Version 1.1 — Public Release
Last Updated: 08.12.2025

1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose of this Document
The Genesis Pack defines all foundational, structural, and immutable elements of the NOORCHAIN protocol.
It serves as the single source of truth for:
initial token supply
allocation model (5 / 5 / 5 / 5 / 80)
governance boundaries
economic constraints
PoSS configuration (application layer)
long-term sustainability commitments
This document is intended for:
institutions
NGOs and educational partners
public organisations
developers and contributors
stakeholders seeking clarity on NOORCHAIN’s mission
It establishes the rules that cannot change after mainnet launch.
1.2 What NOORCHAIN Is
NOORCHAIN 2.1 is a sovereign EVM Layer-1 blockchain designed as a public infrastructure for ethical recognition of human contribution.
The network’s security is provided by a permissioned BFT consensus layer (deterministic finality and accountable operators).
PoSS — Proof of Signal Social — is an application-layer mechanism that structures curator-validated social signals and governs recognition-based distributions under strict transparency rules.
The system:
does not rely on capital, speculation, or yield
does not provide staking or passive income
is non-financial in posture and non-custodial by design
rewards verified participation, not investment
separates consensus security from PoSS social governance (PoSS ≠ consensus)
NOORCHAIN provides a digital public infrastructure designed for:
NGOs
schools
cultural institutions
municipalities
community programs
1.3 Core Principles
Ethics & Transparency
NOORCHAIN publishes all structural rules publicly.
No hidden mechanisms and no financial promises are embedded in protocol design or official communications.
Fixed Supply
Total supply is permanently capped at 299,792,458 NUR.
This cap cannot be increased by governance, upgrades, or operational decisions.
Signal-Based Value Creation (PoSS as Application Layer)
PoSS issues recognition-based distributions exclusively from the PoSS reserve, based on curator-validated social actions, not on financial activity.
PoSS does not secure the chain and does not participate in consensus.
Long-Term Vision
NOORCHAIN is designed for multi-decade sustainability through:
an 8-year halving schedule
an immutable economic model
an institution-ready framework with strict compliance boundaries
2. Genesis Overview
2.1 The Genesis Block
The genesis block defines:
initial supply
balances of institutional addresses
governance parameters and execution constraints
PoSS reserve boundaries and configuration
halving schedule
core protocol parameters
It acts as the constitutional layer of NOORCHAIN.
2.2 Immutable Parameters
The following rules cannot ever change, even by governance:
total supply: 299,792,458 NUR
allocation model: 5% / 5% / 5% / 5% / 80%
PoSS distribution split: 70% participant / 30% curator
halving cycle: every 8 years
no cap expansion and no discretionary issuance outside PoSS rules
non-custodial posture and prohibition of yield framing
Swiss Legal Light CH compliance boundaries (no investment product posture, no financial promises)
2.3 Mission & Long-Term Vision
NOORCHAIN’s mission is to:
recognise positive human contribution
create fair and transparent participation systems
support institutions committed to education, culture, and social impact
build a durable public-good infrastructure
The protocol is intentionally simple, ethical, and stable.
3. Token Supply
3.1 Total Supply
299,792,458 NUR.
Symbolically aligned with the speed of light (m/s) and treated as a constitutional invariant.
3.2 Fixed & Immutable
No cap expansion.
No governance override.
No discretionary issuance outside the reserve-bounded PoSS ruleset.
Supply is an unchangeable constant.
3.3 Halving Schedule (8 years)
Era 1 (0–8): 100% PoSS baseline parameters.
Era 2 (8–16): 50% PoSS baseline parameters.
Era 3 (16–24): 25% PoSS baseline parameters.
Era 4 (24–32): 12.5% PoSS baseline parameters.
Era 5+ (Beyond 32): continues decreasing under the same mechanical rhythm.
This schedule is a protocol pacing mechanism for long-term sustainability and must not be interpreted as a financial projection.
. 4. Genesis Allocation (5 / 5 / 5 / 5 / 80)
4.1 Foundation — 5%
Used for:
governance stewardship
documentation and transparency
mission protection and compliance operations
institutional partnerships and public reporting
Held via 3/5 multi-sig.
The Foundation allocation must not be used for speculation, market-making, or any yield-oriented activity.
4.2 Development Pool — 5%
Allocated to the Development Entity (Swiss Sàrl) for:
protocol engineering and maintenance
infrastructure operations
security work and audits
long-term technical delivery
Transparent vesting is required.
This allocation does not grant authority to modify the supply cap, allocation percentages, halving rhythm, or PoSS structural split.
4.3 PoSS Stimulus — 5%
Supports early ecosystem activation and institutional onboarding:
curator onboarding programs
education and NGO integrations
social initiatives aligned with PoSS guidelines
operational support for early deployments
It must remain non-speculative and managed under documented governance discipline.
4.4 Optional Pre-sale — 5%
Strictly:
private
regulated
Swiss-compliant
multi-sig controlled
vesting required
never open to the public
The pre-sale reserve does not represent an ICO and must not be framed as an investment offering.
If activated, its use must be documented with explicit compliance language and clear separation from Foundation operations.
4.5 PoSS Mintable Supply — 80%
The long-term reserve bounded for PoSS recognition-based distributions.
Issuance is controlled by PoSS rules and the 8-year halving rhythm.
No discretionary issuance is permitted outside PoSS rule enforcement.
4.6 Transparency & Multi-sig Protection
Institutional pools must be:
multi-sig protected
publicly documented
subject to vesting and/or timelock discipline where applicable
auditable in their movements and governance decisions
5. Governance Foundations
5.1 Governance Principles
Governance must always respect:
fixed supply cap
immutable allocation percentages
PoSS structural rules (including 70/30)
PoSS as application layer (PoSS ≠ consensus)
non-custodial posture
Swiss Legal Light CH compliance boundaries
Governance is mission stewardship and protocol integrity management, not market governance.
5.2 Parameter Governance
Adjustable only through governance within bounded scope:
PoSS daily limits
signal-type weights
PoSS activation flag
curator onboarding thresholds and criteria
operational parameters not affecting core invariants
Non-adjustable:
supply cap
halving rhythm
70/30 structural split
5-pool allocation model (5 / 5 / 5 / 5 / 80)
5.3 Multi-sig Structures
A 3-of-5 committee controls execution for:
Foundation treasury actions
governance-managed pools
critical protocol actions defined by the governance framework
The multi-sig is an execution layer and cannot override immutable constraints.
5.4 No Investment Promises
Governance cannot:
offer yields or returns
promote financial gain narratives
run staking programs
operate market-making or liquidity-support programs
publish price targets or performance statements
5.5 Transparency Requirements
All governance decisions must be:
published
archived
auditable
traceable to a documented proposal and execution record
6. Economic Model
6.1 PoSS Reward Split (Immutable)
70% → participant.
30% → curator.
Fixed forever and not governance-adjustable.
6.2 Daily Limits & Anti-Abuse Controls
PoSS enforces:
maximum signals per participant per day
maximum validations per curator per day
daily caps for recognition-based distributions
pattern-based anomaly detection and anti-farming controls
public traceability of signal and validation records
6.3 Halving Interaction
After each halving cycle:
PoSS baseline distribution parameters decrease mechanically
issuance pacing slows
long-term sustainability improves
the protocol posture remains non-financial and avoids yield framing
6.4 Long-Term Sustainability
The model supports:
multi-decade reserve-bounded distribution
predictable institutional planning
stable operational governance within strict immutable constraints
auditable, transparent public-good infrastructure adoption
7. Security Foundations
7.1 Security Posture (Layered Model)
NOORCHAIN security is structured across three layers:
consensus security (permissioned BFT, deterministic finality)
protocol immutability (supply cap, allocation, halving, PoSS structural constraints)
PoSS integrity controls (anti-abuse limits and curator accountability)
The system is designed to protect integrity and institutional trust, not to promote financial risk-taking.
7.2 Risk Mitigation
Security protections include:
permissioned validator accountability at the consensus layer
anti-farming limits at the PoSS layer
curator traceability and public accountability
strict governance boundaries and multi-sig execution discipline
transparent rules that reduce ambiguity and manipulation opportunities
7.3 Integrity of Social Signals
Signals must:
respect daily limits
be authentic and attributable to real-world participation
be validated by approved curators operating under published guidelines
remain publicly auditable as records of submission and validation outcomes
7.4 Curator Validation
Curators follow ethical guidelines defined by the Curator Charter.
Validation activity is visible on-chain, enabling auditability and accountability.
Curators are not investors and do not act as financial intermediaries.
7.5 Hard Limits (Immutable Protections)
Immutable protections include:
fixed supply cap
allocation model (5 / 5 / 5 / 5 / 80)
PoSS structural split (70/30)
8-year halving rhythm
non-custodial posture and prohibition of yield framing
no discretionary issuance outside PoSS rules
7.6 Legal Light Compliance as a Security Boundary
NOORCHAIN operates without:
financial services
custody
investment incentives
yield-bearing mechanisms
protocol-level market-making or liquidity support
This perimeter reduces legal and operational attack surface and strengthens institutional trust.
8. Migration Path
8.1 Testnet → Pre-Mainnet
Testing includes:
PoSS lifecycle behavior (submission, validation, distribution records)
governance parameter boundaries and execution discipline
anti-abuse and limit enforcement
RPC and tooling compatibility for institutional pilots and developers
multi-node stability testing under mainnet-like operational discipline
8.2 Pre-Mainnet → Mainnet
This phase covers:
final parameter locking consistent with immutable constraints
multi-sig activation for institutional pools
institutional address assignment
Genesis Pack publication as the constitutional reference set
operational readiness gates for validators and infrastructure
8.3 Genesis Inclusion Process
Genesis includes:
real addresses
initial balances
protocol parameter sets
governance setup references
PoSS reserve boundaries and configuration
All inclusions must be documented and verifiable.
8.4 Required Institutional Addresses
Foundation.
Development Pool (Sàrl).
PoSS Stimulus Pool.
Pre-sale Pool (optional).
PoSS Reserve (bounded issuance source for PoSS).
8.5 Versioning and Change Control
Future versions will maintain:
public transparency
explicit changelogs
clear version control and publication dates
no modification of immutable constraints
Where operational parameters change (within governance scope), updates must be recorded without introducing market narratives or financial expectations.
