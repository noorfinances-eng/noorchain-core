Last Updated: 08.12.2025
1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose of this Document

The Genesis Pack defines all foundational, structural, and immutable elements of the NOORCHAIN blockchain.
It serves as the single source of truth for:

initial token supply

allocation model (5 / 5 / 5 / 5 / 80)

governance boundaries

economic constraints

PoSS configuration

long-term sustainability commitments

This document is intended for:

institutions

NGOs and educational partners

public organisations

developers and contributors

stakeholders seeking clarity on NOORCHAIN’s mission

It establishes the rules that cannot change after mainnet launch.

1.2 What NOORCHAIN Is

NOORCHAIN is a Social Signal Blockchain powered by PoSS — Proof of Signal Social, a mechanism that recognises meaningful human actions.

The system:

does not rely on capital, speculation, or yield

does not provide staking or passive income

is non-financial, non-custodial, and Swiss Legal Light compliant

rewards verified participation, not investment

NOORCHAIN provides a digital public infrastructure designed for:

NGOs

schools

cultural institutions

municipalities

community programs

1.3 Core Principles
Ethics & Transparency

NOORCHAIN publishes all rules publicly.
No hidden mechanisms. No financial promises.

Fixed Supply

Total supply is permanently capped at 299,792,458 NUR.

Signal-Based Value Creation

PoSS mints tokens based on validated social actions, not on financial activity.

Long-Term Vision

Multi-decade sustainability:

8-year halving schedule

immutable economic model

institution-ready framework

2. Genesis Overview
2.1 The Genesis Block

The genesis block defines:

initial supply

balance of institutional addresses

governance parameters

PoSS configuration

halving schedule

module parameters

It acts as the constitutional layer of NOORCHAIN.

2.2 Immutable Parameters

The following rules cannot ever change, even by governance:

Total supply: 299,792,458 NUR

Allocation model: 5% / 5% / 5% / 5% / 80%

PoSS distribution split: 70% participant / 30% curator

Halving cycle: every 8 years

No inflation, no discretionary minting

Legal Light CH compliance

2.3 Mission & Long-Term Vision

NOORCHAIN’s mission is to:

recognise positive human contribution

create fair and transparent participation systems

support institutions committed to education, culture, and social impact

build a durable public-good infrastructure

The protocol is intentionally simple, ethical, and stable.

3. Token Supply
3.1 Total Supply

299,792,458 NUR

3.2 Fixed & Immutable

No inflation

No discretionary minting

No governance override

Supply is an unchangeable constant.

3.3 Halving Schedule (8 years)
Era	Years	PoSS Reward Level
Era 1	0–8	100%
Era 2	8–16	50%
Era 3	16–24	25%
Era 4	24–32	12.5%
