NOORCHAIN — Investor Whitepaper
Version 1.1
A Swiss Ethical Blockchain for Social Participation
Document for Institutional Partners & Foundations
2025

1. Executive Overview
NOORCHAIN is a Swiss-built blockchain designed to do one thing très clairement:
recognise, record and protect positive human participation.
Unlike traditional blockchains, NOORCHAIN:
•	does not reward capital, staking or speculative behaviour
•	does not offer yield, APY or investment products
•	does not position its token as a financial asset
Its core innovation is the Proof of Social Signal (PoSS) mechanism, which enables:
•	individuals (students, volunteers, participants) to emit “social signals”
•	institutions (NGOs, schools, municipalities, cultural bodies, etc.) — called Curators — to validate those signals
•	a neutral, transparent blockchain ledger to record this participation permanently
NOORCHAIN is engineered to be:
•	Ethical – no financial promises, no yield, no speculation
•	Legally safe – aligned with Swiss Legal Light CH principles
•	Institution-ready – fixed supply, transparent governance, clear documentation
•	Long-term oriented – 8-year halving cycle, multi-decade emission
•	Human-centric – value comes from contribution, not capital
This whitepaper is written specifically for institutional partners, foundations, public actors and responsible capital providers. It focuses on:
•	credibility and governance
•	legal and regulatory positioning
•	economic architecture (non-financial)
•	long-term sustainability
•	social and institutional impact

2. Mission & Purpose
The mission of NOORCHAIN is to provide a neutral, non-financial public infrastructure that allows institutions to:
•	recognise individual and collective contributions
•	create durable and auditable records of participation
•	support education, culture, humanitarian work and community initiatives
•	measure engagement in an ethical, privacy-respecting manner
NOORCHAIN does not aim to replace financial blockchains. It defines a new category:
A social participation infrastructure rather than a financial network.
The project exists to support:
•	schools and universities
•	NGOs and humanitarian organisations
•	municipalities and public programmes
•	cultural institutions and social projects
by providing a safe, transparent and predictable digital backbone for recognising human actions.

3. Why NOORCHAIN Matters to Institutional Partners
Institutions increasingly face structural questions:
•	How to measure engagement and participation reliably across programmes and years?
•	How to create digital proof of contribution that is auditable and tamper-resistant?
•	How to adopt blockchain technology without financial risk or regulatory exposure?
•	How to protect beneficiaries from speculative environments and incentives?
NOORCHAIN responds with a set of deliberate design choices:
•	Non-custodial by design
o	No user funds are held by the project.
o	Users retain control of their wallets at all times.
•	Non-financial token model
o	NUR is a utility token for participation, not an investment product.
•	Fixed total supply
o	299,792,458 NUR, reflecting the speed of light (symbolic link to “clarity” and “transparency”).
o	No additional minting beyond PoSS reserves.
•	Transparent governance architecture
o	Clear separation between Foundation, Multi-sig Committee and Dev Sàrl.
•	Institutional fit
o	Framework designed for NGOs, schools, municipalities, cultural and research institutions.
For foundations, institutions and impact-driven funds, NOORCHAIN is a way to support a high-integrity, public-good infrastructure that is technically advanced but legally simple.

4. Legal Positioning (Switzerland — Legal Light CH)
NOORCHAIN operates under a strict Legal Light CH interpretation, designed to keep the project in the safest possible regulatory perimeter in Switzerland.
4.1 Key Compliance Pillars
•	No custody
o	NOORCHAIN does not hold, manage or intermediate user assets.
•	No financial product
o	NUR is a non-financial, utility token used inside the protocol.
o	It is not marketed or structured as an investment.
•	No yield, no return expectations
o	PoSS rewards follow protocol rules and are symbolic, not financial products.
•	No internal PSP activity
o	The project does not provide crypto–fiat conversion or payment services.
o	Any future conversion is delegated to regulated third-party PSPs.
•	Full transparency
o	Documentation, governance charters, legal frameworks and key parameters are public.
This configuration makes NOORCHAIN:
•	compatible with NGOs, educational institutions, municipalities and cultural bodies
•	attractive for impact-oriented investors who want low regulatory risk
•	aligned with Swiss expectations of transparency and non-speculative innovation
5. Core Innovation — Proof of Social Signal (PoSS)
PoSS is the central innovation of NOORCHAIN: a mechanism that recognises and records positive social actions.
5.1 How PoSS Works
1.	Action
o	A participant (student, volunteer, citizen, etc.) carries out a positive action (e.g. volunteering, school engagement, community participation).
2.	Signal
o	A digital “social signal” is submitted to the network.
3.	Validation
o	An approved Curator (school, NGO, municipal service, cultural institution, etc.) verifies the action.
4.	Reward
o	The protocol issues a symbolic reward from the PoSS reserve, split as:
	70% to the participant
	30% to the validating Curator
5.2 Nature of PoSS Rewards
PoSS is not:
•	a financial yield mechanism
•	a “play-to-earn” or “stake-to-earn” system
•	a speculative distribution model
PoSS is a recognition layer:
•	designed to reflect effort and contribution, not capital
•	structured around ethical validation by institutions
•	engineered with daily limits and anti-abuse safeguards

6. Economic Architecture (Non-Financial Model)
The NOORCHAIN economic model is intentionally simple and transparent.
6.1 Genesis Supply and Distribution
Total supply is fixed at:
299,792,458 NUR
Genesis allocation:
Allocation	Share	Purpose
Foundation	5%	Mission, governance, transparency, public good
Dev Sàrl	5%	Technical development, infrastructure
PoSS Stimulus	5%	Early ecosystem activation and pilots
Pre-sale (optional)	5%	Institutional fundraising only (if used)
PoSS Reserve	80%	Multi-decade PoSS emission
6.2 Zero Inflation
•	No new supply beyond the defined cap.
•	No discretionary minting.
•	No hidden monetary expansions.
This provides:
•	stability for institutions
•	predictable behaviour across decades
•	clear boundaries for governance and economic design

7. Governance Architecture (Swiss Institutional Model)
NOORCHAIN’s governance structure is designed around Swiss standards of independence, transparency and separation of roles.
7.1 NOORCHAIN Foundation (Non-Profit)
The Foundation:
•	holds the mission and public-good orientation of the project
•	maintains documentation, legal alignment and transparency
•	coordinates governance processes
•	supervises Curators and ethics
•	acts as neutral steward of the protocol
It does not:
•	hold user assets
•	provide financial services
•	act as an investment promoter
7.2 Multi-sig Committee (3/5)
The Multi-sig Committee is the on-chain executor of approved governance decisions.
Responsibilities:
•	execute parameter updates within pre-defined boundaries
•	manage the Foundation allocation transparently
•	apply emergency procedures when needed
•	oversee upgrades and changes consistent with Legal Light CH
It cannot alter immutable elements such as:
•	total supply
•	5/5/5/5/80 allocation structure
•	PoSS 70/30 reward split
•	8-year halving schedule
7.3 Noor Dev Sàrl (Technical Entity)
A Swiss company responsible for:
•	maintaining the NOORCHAIN core code
•	building dApps and ecosystem tools (Curators Hub, CCN Studio, NOOR Pay, dashboards)
•	supporting integration with institutional partners
The Sàrl has no direct protocol governance power and cannot act on behalf of users or control Foundation funds.
7.4 Curators
Curators are trusted institutions (schools, NGOs, municipalities, cultural institutions, etc.) that:
•	validate PoSS signals
•	apply ethical rules and validation standards
•	earn the structural 30% PoSS share as a symbolic recognition of their role
They:
•	do not control governance
•	do not handle user assets
•	operate within a published ethical framework

8. Risk Management & Institutional Safety
NOORCHAIN has been designed for predictability and resilience from an institutional perspective.
8.1 Technical Risk
Mitigation measures:
•	modular architecture based on Cosmos SDK + Ethermint
•	minimalistic on-chain logic, no complex DeFi components
•	deterministic PoSS rules and parameters
•	audits and security reviews planned
•	transparent changelog and public codebase
8.2 Social & Operational Risk
PoSS involves human validation. Safeguards include:
•	daily limits per participant and per Curator
•	public validation logs
•	tiered Curator system with clear responsibilities
•	possibility to suspend or rotate Curators in case of abuse
8.3 Legal & Compliance Risk
Mitigation by design:
•	no custody, no yield, no public token sale
•	no financial product and no investment branding
•	adherence to Legal Light CH
•	use of external regulated PSPs for any future fiat conversion
8.4 Economic Stability
The combination of:
•	fixed supply
•	8-year halving
•	non-financial use of NUR
ensures independence from market cycles and makes the system usable even if external token markets fluctuate.

9. Institutional Use Cases
NOORCHAIN is conceived as a public social infrastructure, not a trading platform.

10. Ecosystem Vision (Long-Term Strategy)
NOORCHAIN is not a single product; it is a platform for a family of institutional tools.
Key components:
•	Curators Hub — professional interface for signal validation and monitoring
•	CCN Studio (Community Content Network) — environment for certified educational and social content
•	NOOR Pay (internal utility only) — non-financial signalling/payments infrastructure inside the ecosystem
•	Dashboards & APIs — analytics, reporting and integration tools for institutional partners
Growth is expected to come from:
•	partnerships with educational networks
•	NGO and foundation programmes
•	municipal and cultural initiatives
•	research and innovation projects

11. Market Positioning (Non-Speculative Architecture)
NOORCHAIN is deliberately non-speculative.
11.1 What NOORCHAIN Is Not
•	not a DeFi platform
•	not a staking or yield product
•	not a trading engine
•	not an investment token or security
•	not a vehicle to maximise returns
11.2 What NOORCHAIN Represents
•	a public-good digital infrastructure
•	a proof-of-contribution protocol
•	a Swiss-governed utility network
•	a social participation ledger for institutions
This makes it attractive for:
•	NGOs and foundations
•	schools and universities
•	municipalities and public bodies
•	research and cultural organisations

12. Competitive Landscape (Human-Centric Positioning)
Most existing blockchain projects are centred on financial dynamics.
•	Bitcoin & PoW ecosystems — monetary focus, energy-intensive, capital-based
•	Ethereum & PoS platforms — governance and rewards driven by stake
•	DeFi and social tokens — highly exposed to speculation, regulatory risk, and complex tokenomics
NOORCHAIN occupies a distinct space:
A Social Participation Infrastructure (SPI) where value is tied to verified human action, not capital.
This category is largely unoccupied today, giving NOORCHAIN a strong first-mover advantage.

13. Strategic Importance for Institutions
NOORCHAIN addresses a clear gap:
•	there is no neutral, non-financial digital layer dedicated to participation and contribution
It offers institutions:
•	a way to measure and recognise engagement
•	a mechanism to create transparent, auditable records
•	a system that avoids financial and speculative complexity
From an institutional standpoint, NOORCHAIN is:
•	a tool of governance and accountability, not a financial experiment
•	a foundation for social innovation, not a substitute for markets

14. Why Investors Support NOORCHAIN (Without Financial Products)
NOORCHAIN does not offer investment products, yields or APY. The NUR token is not marketed as a financial instrument.
So why support it?
Because investors and foundations can:
•	back a neutral, Swiss-governed public infrastructure
•	contribute to a first-of-its-kind participation blockchain
•	align with ESG, social impact and philanthropic mandates
•	be part of a multi-decade infrastructure project with high institutional relevance
Supporters of NOORCHAIN:
•	do not receive promises of returns
•	do not receive financial guarantees
•	do not acquire special rights based on token ownership
They help to build and maintain a shared, ethical digital infrastructure.

15. Institutional Fit and Adoption Criteria
Public and semi-public institutions typically require:
•	neutrality
•	predictability
•	regulatory clarity
•	transparency
•	long-term viability
NOORCHAIN has been constructed specifically around these requirements:
•	fixed supply
•	immutable core rules (supply, PoSS split, allocation, halving)
•	Legal Light CH alignment
•	non-financial positioning
•	clear documentation and governance
16. Funding & Sustainability Model (High-Level)
Although NUR is non-financial, the ecosystem itself requires funding.
Sources of funding may include:
•	pre-mainnet institutional commitments (Phase 6.B)
•	grants and sponsorships
•	collaborations with NGOs, schools and municipalities
•	Sàrl service revenue (e.g. integration, tools, training)
•	research and innovation programmes
There is no dependency on public token sales, ICOs or speculative offerings.

17. Long-Term Design: Fixed Supply & 8-Year Halving
NOORCHAIN is explicitly designed as a multi-decade project.
Key pillars:
•	Fixed total supply — 299,792,458 NUR, never changeable
•	8-year halving cycle — issuance of PoSS rewards decreases gradually over 8-year steps
•	slow, predictable emission — aligned with institutional timeframes
This gives institutions:
•	long-term visibility on the system’s behaviour
•	assurance that core economic rules will not change
•	confidence that the protocol cannot be monetarily “captured” or inflated

18. Why Switzerland?
Switzerland is a deliberate jurisdictional choice:
•	strong tradition of neutrality and governance quality
•	clear frameworks for non-profit foundations
•	legal environment supportive of utility-based, non-financial blockchain projects
This provides:
•	institutional credibility
•	a stable legal base
•	familiarity for NGOs, international organisations and public partners

19. Institutional Onboarding Strategy
NOORCHAIN will use a progressive onboarding process:
1.	Awareness — documentation, website, whitepapers, presentations
2.	Trial & Pilots — small-scale PoSS simulations, limited programmes
3.	Curator Certification — ethical guidelines, onboarding process, Bronze/Silver/Gold tiers
4.	Integration — embedding NOORCHAIN into programmes and workflows
5.	Ecosystem Growth — network effects via institutional collaboration
At each stage, the emphasis remains on clarity, control and low risk for institutions.

20. Infrastructure Roadmap (Summary)
The development of NOORCHAIN follows a structured roadmap:
•	Phases 1–4: Core architecture, PoSS module, testnet and documentation (completed)
•	Phase 6: Public identity, website, whitepapers, legal pack, Genesis Pack (in progress)
•	Phase 7: Pre-mainnet — institutional addresses, genesis finalisation, multi-sig activation
•	Phase 8: Mainnet 1.0 — launch, first Curators, core dApps
•	Phase 9: Ecosystem applications — Curators Hub, CCN Studio, dashboards, educational and NGO tools
•	Phase 10 (optional): Interoperability & minimal, responsible liquidity
The focus is stability and clarity, not speed or hype.

21. Long-Term Vision (25-Year Perspective)
Over the next decades, NOORCHAIN aims to become:
•	a universal participation ledger for civil society
•	a trusted digital backbone for public-interest programmes
•	a reference model for ethical, non-financial blockchain infrastructures
Its success will be measured not in token price, but in:
•	number of institutions using it
•	diversity of programmes supported
•	quality and volume of recorded social participation
•	trust from public actors and responsible capital providers

22. Funding Strategy (Legal Light & Non-Financial)
NOORCHAIN’s funding strategy is strictly separated from token mechanics.
22.1 No Public Token Sale
There is:
•	no ICO / IDO / public sale
•	no launchpad
•	no investment campaign based on token appreciation
This mitigates:
•	speculative pressure
•	regulatory and legal risk
•	reputational exposure
22.2 Pre-Mainnet Institutional Funding (Phase 6.B)
A pre-mainnet funding round may be organised, with:
•	a target of 150,000–300,000 CHF
•	participants limited to qualified Swiss and institutional actors
•	support based on signed commitments and clear legal documentation
•	no financial promises, no yields and no token-based incentives
Investors support the infrastructure and development, not token speculation.

23. The NOORCHAIN Value Proposition for Institutions
In summary, institutions may choose NOORCHAIN because it offers:
•	Stability over speculation
•	Swiss governance and legal alignment
•	Transparent emission and immutable rules
•	Non-financial, non-custodial architecture
•	Support for education, NGOs, culture and communities
•	Ethical innovation focused on human contribution
NOORCHAIN treats blockchain as public infrastructure, not as a financial product.

24. Expansion Potential Without Speculation
NOORCHAIN can expand globally through:
•	institutional networks
•	educational systems
•	NGO coalitions
•	cultural and municipal partnerships
•	research alliances
This growth does not depend on yields or trading volume, but on the utility of the infrastructure.

25. Risk Profile (Summary)
From an investor and institutional standpoint, the NOORCHAIN risk profile can be summarised as follows:
•	Market risk — Low to Moderate
o	The protocol does not depend on token price, but secondary markets may exist.
•	Regulatory risk — Very Low
o	Legal Light CH alignment, no yield, no custody, no public sale.
•	Technological risk — Moderate
o	Inherent to any blockchain, mitigated by simplicity and careful design.
•	Adoption risk — Moderate
o	Institutions adopt slowly but tend to stay long-term once integrated.
•	Reputational risk — Low
o	No speculative narratives, cautious communication and clear documentation.
•	Governance risk — Low
o	Immutable core rules, multi-sig, non-financial governance structure.
•	Social-layer risk — Moderate
o	Managed via Curator rules, limits, transparency and oversight.
•	Long-term sustainability risk — Low
o	Fixed supply, 8-year halving, institutional orientation.
26. Why NOORCHAIN Is a High-Integrity Opportunity (Non-Financial)
Even without financial products, NOORCHAIN offers a high-integrity opportunity for:
•	philanthropic foundations
•	impact funds
•	public and semi-public institutions
•	responsible private capital
It combines:
•	regulatory clarity (Legal Light CH)
•	ethical positioning (no speculation, no yield)
•	multi-decade sustainability (fixed supply, halving)
•	governance robustness (multi-sig, immutable rules)
•	clear mission (social participation and institutional utility)
Supporters are not buying into a token; they are helping to build a new layer of public infrastructure.

27. Conclusion & Strategic Outlook
NOORCHAIN is:
•	a Swiss-governed, non-financial blockchain
•	designed for institutions, not traders
•	built as a public-good infrastructure for social participation
It brings together:
•	fixed and immutable economic rules
•	a clear legal and governance framework
•	a human-centric protocol (PoSS)
•	a long-term vision measured in decades
As education systems, NGOs, municipalities and cultural institutions continue to digitise their processes, the need for neutral, transparent and safe infrastructures will grow.
NOORCHAIN is positioned to answer that need by:
•	recognising and recording human contribution
•	providing institutions with a durable tool for measuring participation
•	enabling responsible capital to support a genuinely public-interest blockchain
This Investor Whitepaper Version 1.1 forms part of the official NOORCHAIN documentation alongside the Genesis Pack, Governance and Legal Framework, Public Whitepapers and Technical Files.
It is not an offer of securities, does not describe an investment product and does not contain any financial promises. It is a description of a public infrastructure project that institutions and responsible partners are invited to support and use.
