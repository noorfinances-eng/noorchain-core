Legal Disclaimer (Public Version)

This document is informational and describes the design and mission of NOORCHAIN.
It does not constitute financial advice, investment guidance, a prospectus, or a solicitation.
NOORCHAIN is a non-financial, non-custodial blockchain protocol operating under the Swiss Legal Light CH framework.

1. Introduction

NOORCHAIN is a Swiss-based, ethical blockchain designed to recognize and validate positive human actions.

Traditional blockchains reward financial power or computational ability.
NOORCHAIN introduces a new paradigm:

Value is created through verified social participation, not financial resources.

Key characteristics:

non-financial

non-custodial

transparent

aligned with Swiss Legal Light CH

designed for institutions, NGOs, educators, and communities

Its objective is simple:

Provide a neutral, transparent, and long-term digital infrastructure that institutions and communities can trust.

2. Vision

Most digital systems reward economic capital, attention capture, or computational resources.
NOORCHAIN shifts this dynamic by recognizing human engagement as a measurable, verifiable, meaningful contribution.

Vision Statement

Build the first global infrastructure where positive social actions create value in an ethical, transparent, and verifiable way.

This vision encourages:

participation

responsibility

community involvement

social contribution

all without speculation or financial incentives.

3. What Makes NOORCHAIN Unique

NOORCHAIN introduces several foundational innovations:

• Proof of Signal Social (PoSS)

A protocol mechanism that validates real, positive human actions.

• Fixed Supply — 299,792,458 NUR

No inflation. No additional minting. Ever.

• Immutable Ethical Reward Split — 70/30

70% to the participant, 30% to the curator.
Permanent, protocol-encoded, non-modifiable.

• Halving Every 8 Years

A slow, predictable supply emission schedule designed for sustainability.

• Non-Speculative by Design

No staking yield, no APR/APY, no financial promises.

• Institution-Ready

Built for NGOs, schools, cultural institutions, municipalities, and communities.
Focused on transparency, reliability, and ethical interaction.

NOORCHAIN is not a financial product.
It is an institutional infrastructure designed to bring visibility and recognition to positive human participation.

4. The Role of PoSS (Proof of Signal Social)

PoSS transforms positive actions into verifiable on-chain signals, validated by trusted curators.

A “signal” can represent:

class participation

volunteer work

involvement in community projects

engagement in cultural or social activities

contributions to public or educational programs

Curators (teachers, NGOs, schools, institutions) validate signals ethically and transparently.

Rewards under PoSS:

symbolic

non-financial

protocol-controlled

strictly capped by the PoSS reserve

not tied to staking, deposit, or yield

PoSS is a social recognition system, not a financial incentive mechanism.

5. Economic Model

NOORCHAIN follows a transparent and immutable economic model built for public-good infrastructure.

5.1 Fixed Supply

299,792,458 NUR, inspired by the speed of light.
This supply is immutable and encoded at genesis.

No inflation.
No discretionary minting.
No token creation beyond the PoSS reserve.

5.2 Genesis Allocation (5 / 5 / 5 / 5 / 80)

5% Foundation — governance, transparency, institutional partnerships

5% Development Entity (Sàrl) — technical maintenance, R&D

5% PoSS Stimulus — early support for NGOs, schools, pilots

5% Pre-sale (optional, regulated) — Swiss-only, vested, if activated

80% PoSS Reserve — long-term PoSS emission over several eras

These values are immutable and cannot be changed by governance.

5.3 No Speculation Features

NOORCHAIN deliberately excludes:

staking yield

APR/APY

liquidity pools operated by the Foundation

financial returns

investment mechanisms

farming, locking, or deposit-based rewards

This ensures strict compliance with Swiss Legal Light CH standards.

6. Curators: Guardians of Integrity

Curators are community-trusted entities:

NGOs

schools & educators

social institutions

cultural organizations

associations

community groups

Curators do not receive financial benefits.
Their role is ethical and mission-oriented:

validate real human actions

ensure fairness

prevent misuse

reinforce the social purpose of the protocol

Curators are central to the integrity and legitimacy of PoSS.

7. Technology Overview

NOORCHAIN is built on secure, well-established, and institution-friendly components:

Cosmos SDK — modular, transparent, proven

Ethermint (EVM) — enabling future compatibility with Ethereum tooling

Custom PoSS Module — parameter-driven, auditable, predictable

The architecture is intentionally simple and long-term:

predictable

auditable

minimal risk

stable for institutional adoption

free of DeFi, custodial layers, or yield engineering

NOORCHAIN aims to be a public-good digital ledger, not a financial system.

8. Legal & Compliance Foundations

NOORCHAIN is fully aligned with the Swiss Legal Light CH framework:

non-custodial (no private keys, no user funds)

no financial products

no investment offering

no speculative messaging

no yield, APR, APY, or financial remuneration

transparent governance

symbolic, protocol-based rewards

These principles ensure safety for:

public institutions

NGOs

educators

municipalities

community programs

The protocol is designed to operate within Switzerland’s strict non-financial classification.

9. Use Cases
Education

participation tracking

recognition of student effort

extracurricular validation

transparent engagement records

NGOs & Humanitarian Projects

volunteer verification

transparent participation logs

community contribution measurement

Communities & Municipalities

civic engagement tracking

cultural participation reporting

collaborative project validation

Cultural Institutions

event attendance

cultural engagement metrics

public program participation

NOORCHAIN acts as a neutral, durable, transparent participation ledger.

10. Governance Principles

NOORCHAIN governance is designed for stability, neutrality, and long-term clarity.

• Foundation (5%)

Public-good mission, transparency, compliance, documentation.

• Multi-sig Committee (3/5)

Executes governance-approved actions.
Cannot modify supply, PoSS rules, or economic invariants.

• Curators

Advisory and validation role.
No treasury control or governance authority.

• Immutable Protocol Rules

fixed supply

70/30 PoSS split

8-year halving

allocation percentages (5/5/5/5/80)

Legal Light CH restrictions

Governance is transparent, documented, and strictly non-financial.

11. Long-Term Vision

NOORCHAIN aims to become a global reference for:

digital participation records

ethical recognition systems

community engagement metrics

transparent validation tools

non-financial public infrastructure

Its architecture — multi-era PoSS distribution, fixed supply, and institutional neutrality — makes it a long-term digital platform, not a speculative asset.

12. Conclusion

NOORCHAIN introduces a new category of blockchain:

A human-centered, ethical, non-financial participation protocol.

By recognizing positive actions transparently and responsibly, NOORCHAIN provides a durable foundation for communities, educators, institutions, and public organizations worldwide.

It is designed for public good, ethical technology, and transparent participation — not for speculation or financial incentives.
