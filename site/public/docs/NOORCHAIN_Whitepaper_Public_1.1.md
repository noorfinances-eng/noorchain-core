1. Executive Summary
1.1 Vision
NOORCHAIN introduces a shift in how digital systems perceive value.
Traditional networks reward capital, hardware, or financial exposure.
NOORCHAIN rewards human contribution—measured through verified actions rather than monetary inputs.
Its central innovation, the Proof of Social Signal (PoSS) mechanism, enables the protocol to acknowledge participation, engagement, effort, and civic contribution in a transparent and ethical manner.
The objective is clear:
Build a long-term digital infrastructure where value is created by meaningful action, not capital accumulation.
________________________________________
1.2 Mission
To create the first blockchain where positive human actions, validated by trusted institutions, generate recognition through a transparent and non-financial mechanism.
The mission rests on five pillars:
•	Ethical participation: Encouraging meaningful engagement.
•	Transparency: Clear rules, no hidden incentives or financial promises.
•	Durability: A multi-decade economic and governance model.
•	Social recognition: Giving visibility and structure to real-world contribution.
•	Neutral technology: A simple, predictable, auditable infrastructure.
NOORCHAIN is designed not for financial speculation, but for communities, institutions, NGOs, schools, and public initiatives.
________________________________________
1.3 What Makes NOORCHAIN Unique
Unlike traditional blockchains, NOORCHAIN:
•	rewards actions, not wealth
•	uses a fixed supply: 299,792,458 NUR
•	includes no staking, no APR, no yield product
•	prohibits any financial promises
•	enforces an immutable 70% participant / 30% curator reward split
•	follows a long-term 8-year halving cycle
•	aligns with real institutions: schools, NGOs, communities
•	is fully compatible with Swiss Legal Light CH requirements
NOORCHAIN does not try to replace financial blockchains.
It introduces a new category: a human-centric digital infrastructure.
________________________________________
1.4 Ethical Foundations
NOORCHAIN is built upon strict ethical commitments:
•	No financial incentives to join the system
•	No hidden mechanisms or privileged participants
•	No speculation encouraged by the protocol
•	No privileged access based on wealth
•	No staking, yield, or financial promises
Its purpose is to create a fair, transparent, and sustainable digital environment that elevates human contribution.
________________________________________
2. Introduction
2.1 The Limitations of Traditional Blockchains
Over the last decade, blockchain technology has transformed digital infrastructure by enabling transparency, decentralisation, and trust without intermediaries.
However, mainstream blockchains rely on financial or computational power as the core driver of participation:
•	Proof-of-Work: rewards users with the most hardware and energy resources
•	Proof-of-Stake: rewards users with the largest token holdings
•	DeFi systems: benefit those who can commit significant capital
•	DAO voting: often dominated by those who can buy governance power
These systems reproduce the same economic asymmetries found in traditional finance.
They recognise capital, not human contribution.
They do not capture:
•	community participation
•	educational engagement
•	cultural contribution
•	volunteer and humanitarian work
•	civic collaboration
The blockchain revolution improved digital trust, but it largely ignored social value.
________________________________________
2.2 The Problem: Social Contribution Is Invisible
Every day, individuals create value through actions such as:
•	helping an association
•	participating in a class
•	contributing to a community project
•	engaging in cultural or civic initiatives
•	collaborating within a group or institution
These actions strengthen society, yet they remain unrecorded by current digital systems.
Traditional blockchains neither measure nor recognise these contributions because they:
•	generate no hash power
•	involve no staking capital
•	do not affect market dynamics
Human value is real, but digitally invisible.
________________________________________
2.3 The Opportunity: A Human-Centric Protocol
There is a clear opportunity for an infrastructure capable of:
•	recognising participation
•	validating engagement ethically
•	documenting social contribution
•	enabling institutions to measure impact
•	motivating positive behaviours without financial incentives
NOORCHAIN addresses this gap by creating the world’s first blockchain where social actions generate verifiable, recognised digital signals.
This unlocks a new type of digital economy:
•	stable
•	transparent
•	equitable
•	community-driven
•	fully non-financial
An economy where what matters is not what you own, but what you do.
________________________________________
2.4 A Participation-Oriented Protocol
A human-centric protocol shifts the focus from assets to actions.
NOORCHAIN formalises this through a structured framework where:
•	participation
•	contribution
•	collaboration
•	responsibility
•	ethical behaviour
are the core sources of value.
The Proof of Social Signal (PoSS) mechanism ensures that positive actions are:
•	recorded
•	validated
•	rewarded ethically
•	visible on-chain
•	protected from abuse
With NOORCHAIN, meaningful actions gain a digital presence and recognition, creating a new foundation for social accountability and engagement.
________________________________________
3. Foundational Concepts of NOORCHAIN
3.1 A New Paradigm: Social Value as Digital Value
Traditional digital systems equate value with financial resources or computational capacity.
NOORCHAIN introduces a fundamentally different paradigm:
Value = positive human action validated by trusted actors.
This shift enables:
•	inclusive participation
•	equitable recognition
•	transparent contribution records
•	a more balanced digital ecosystem
NOORCHAIN does not attempt to compete with financial blockchains.
It expands the concept of value by giving social contribution a durable and verifiable place in the digital world.
________________________________________
3.2 Signals: The Fundamental Units of Contribution
In the NOORCHAIN ecosystem, a signal is the atomic unit representing a real, positive human action.
A signal may correspond to:
•	participation in an educational activity
•	volunteer work in an NGO
•	involvement in community projects
•	cultural or civic engagement
•	collaborative contributions within institutions
Signals are:
•	simple
•	universal
•	non-financial
•	accessible to all
•	verifiable
Their purpose is not to quantify productivity or performance, but to recognise meaningful engagement.
By making contribution measurable and durable, NOORCHAIN turns previously invisible social value into an active part of digital infrastructure.
________________________________________
3.3 Curators: Guardians of Legitimacy
Curators play a central role in ensuring integrity and trust.
They are not investors and do not act for financial gain.
They are ethical validators, typically institutions such as:
•	schools and educational actors
•	associations and NGOs
•	cultural institutions
•	community organisations
•	social-service entities
Their responsibilities include:
•	validating the authenticity of signals
•	applying ethical guidelines
•	safeguarding against misuse
•	ensuring transparency and impartiality
Curators represent the bridge between real-world human action and its on-chain recognition.
They embody the social legitimacy of the system.
________________________________________
3.4 An Ethical and Accessible Digital Infrastructure
NOORCHAIN follows a simple principle:
Technology must serve human participation, not overpower it.
The infrastructure is designed to be:
•	readable
•	transparent
•	accessible
•	predictable
•	suitable for institutions
•	compliant with non-financial frameworks
There are no complex financial mechanics, no yield models, and no speculative incentives.
The objective is durability, clarity, and public trust.
________________________________________
3.5 Transparency and Public Accountability
Trust is built through visible rules and verifiable processes.
NOORCHAIN embeds transparency at every layer:
•	public validation rules
•	immutable structural parameters
•	fixed supply
•	transparent PoSS logic
•	documented governance
•	curator responsibilities encoded in open guidelines
Transparency is not decorative — it is a structural guarantee of integrity.
By combining technological clarity with institutional alignment, NOORCHAIN establishes a foundation suitable for long-term public good.
________________________________________
4. System Architecture
4.1 Overview of NOORCHAIN’s Architectural Model
NOORCHAIN is built on a modern, modular and auditable architecture designed for clarity, long-term sustainability and institutional reliability.
Its technical backbone combines two proven technologies:
•	Cosmos SDK — modular structure, secure state management, parameter-based governance
•	Ethermint (EVM-compatible) — enabling future integrations, tools and interoperability
This architectural choice reflects NOORCHAIN’s mission:
•	simplicity over complexity
•	transparency over opacity
•	predictability over speculation
•	public-good infrastructure over financial engineering
NOORCHAIN is not designed as a financial platform.
It is a social infrastructure, supporting participation, validation and institutional use cases in a neutral and ethical environment.
The system is intentionally minimalistic: each module exists to support the protocol’s mission and nothing more.
________________________________________
4.2 Core Modules of the Architecture
NOORCHAIN contains a limited yet powerful set of modules, each with a well-defined purpose and clear boundaries.
4.2.1 Bank Module
The Bank module is responsible for:
•	managing account balances
•	controlling the PoSS minting process
•	ensuring supply consistency
•	applying the immutable 70/30 reward split
•	guaranteeing correct distribution of validated rewards
It acts as the monetary engine of the protocol, ensuring safe and transparent handling of NUR across all users and curators.
________________________________________
4.2.2 Governance Module
The governance module handles all adjustable parameters within NOORCHAIN.
It is deliberately restricted:
Governance CANNOT modify:
•	total supply
•	5/5/5/5/80 allocation
•	PoSS structural 70/30 split
•	8-year halving cycle
These rules are permanently outside the scope of governance.
What governance CAN update:
•	PoSS daily limits
•	signal weight configurations
•	activation/deactivation of PoSS
•	other non-structural parameters
This clear boundary preserves integrity and regulatory alignment while allowing operational flexibility.
________________________________________
4.2.3 PoSS Module (Proof of Social Signal)
The PoSS module is the heart of NOORCHAIN.
It manages:
•	signal submission
•	queueing and validation
•	curator review
•	daily usage limits
•	reward calculation
•	halving logic
•	distribution of participant and curator shares
•	abuse prevention mechanisms
It transforms real human action into structured, traceable and verifiable on-chain evidence.
The PoSS module does not reward financial investment or hardware power.
It rewards positive human participation, validated by trusted institutions.
________________________________________
4.2.4 EVM Module (Ethermint)
The Ethermint module ensures:
•	full EVM compatibility
•	support for future community tools
•	integration with established blockchain standards
•	institutional interoperability without introducing DeFi risks
NOORCHAIN does not position itself as a financial smart-contract platform.
EVM compatibility is provided to support future social tools, not speculative finance.
________________________________________
4.2.5 Auth & Accounts Modules
These modules guarantee:
•	secure account management
•	transaction reliability
•	predictable identity handling in the ecosystem
They form the foundational security layer of the protocol.
________________________________________
4.3 Data Structures and On-Chain Transparency
To maintain auditability and institutional trust, NOORCHAIN uses clear and readable data structures.
4.3.1 Signal Registry
Each submitted signal includes:
•	emitter address
•	unique signal ID
•	timestamp
•	signal type
•	status (pending / validated / rejected)
________________________________________
4.3.2 Validation Registry
Each validation stores:
•	curator address
•	validation result
•	timestamp
•	reference to the corresponding signal
This creates a transparent, immutable validation trail.
________________________________________
4.3.3 Daily Counters
Daily counters enforce:
•	fairness
•	anti-spam controls
•	prevention of automated abuse
•	reward pacing aligned with long-term supply
________________________________________
4.3.4 Halving Counters
These structures monitor:
•	progression through halving cycles
•	reward recalculations every 8 years
They guarantee predictable, multi-decade PoSS emissions.
________________________________________
4.4 Full Signal Processing Pipeline
A complete signal lifecycle follows this sequence:
1.	Real-world action
2.	Signal submission
3.	Blockchain registration
4.	Queueing for review
5.	Curator validation
6.	PoSS rule checks
7.	Reward calculation (base × weight × halving)
8.	70/30 reward distribution
9.	Immutable archival
This pipeline is designed to be:
•	simple
•	verifiable
•	ethically aligned
•	institutionally acceptable
•	robust under long-term usage
________________________________________
4.5 Curator Validation Process
Curators act as the ethical filter of the protocol.
Validation steps:
1.	Review pending signal
2.	Assess legitimacy of the action
3.	Apply ethical and procedural guidelines
4.	Approve or reject
5.	Trigger PoSS logic
6.	Record action on-chain
Curators are social validators, not economic actors.
Their integrity ensures the integrity of NOORCHAIN.
________________________________________
4.6 Architectural Principles
NOORCHAIN adheres to strong guiding principles:
•	Simplicity — infrastructure must remain comprehensible
•	Auditability — public, transparent rules
•	Durability — multi-decade lifespan
•	Separation of concerns — governance vs. validation vs. technical roles
•	Ethical alignment — architecture supports the mission, never speculation
•	Interoperability — optional EVM support without introducing financial risk
This architecture is intentionally modest but highly robust.
It serves one purpose: recognising and structuring positive human participation.
________________________________________
5. Proof of Social Signal (PoSS)
(Core Mechanism — Extended Version)
5.1 Why PoSS Exists
Traditional blockchain reward models are fundamentally financial.
They reward:
•	computational power (Proof-of-Work),
•	capital ownership (Proof-of-Stake),
•	liquidity provision (DeFi),
•	token accumulation (DAO governance),
but never human contribution.
Millions of socially meaningful actions — participation in class, volunteering, community support, cultural engagement — generate value every day, yet none of it is captured by existing digital systems.
PoSS was created to correct this imbalance.
It introduces a protocol where rewards are:
•	tied to real actions,
•	validated ethically,
•	structured transparently,
•	decoupled from financial incentives.
PoSS transforms human contribution into a verifiable digital signal — a fundamental innovation in the architecture of blockchain-based participation.
________________________________________
5.2 Complete Lifecycle of a PoSS Signal
The full lifecycle of a PoSS event is designed to be transparent, predictable and institution-friendly.
1.	Real-world action
A student participates, a volunteer helps, a citizen contributes to a local initiative.
2.	Signal submission
The action is translated into a simple digital signal.
3.	On-chain registration
The signal enters the protocol and receives a unique identifier.
4.	Queueing for validation
Signals wait in a public queue, ensuring fairness and transparency.
5.	Curator review
A curator — teacher, NGO, institution — validates or rejects the signal.
6.	PoSS rule enforcement
The module checks daily limits, curator capacity, and abuse-prevention rules.
7.	Reward calculation
Reward = BaseReward × Weight × HalvingCoefficient
8.	Immutable 70/30 distribution
o	70% → participant
o	30% → curator
9.	Archiving
The event becomes part of an immutable public record.
This sequence ensures PoSS remains predictable, auditable, and ethically aligned.
________________________________________
5.3 The 70/30 Distribution Model (Immutable)
The structural reward split is permanently encoded in the protocol:
•	70% to the participant
•	30% to the curator
This rule is not governance-adjustable and cannot be modified after genesis.
Reasons for immutability:
•	protects the integrity of the mission
•	prevents financial distortion
•	maintains ethical alignment
•	ensures balanced ecosystem incentives
•	avoids power asymmetries between curators and users
The 70/30 model is symbolic, not financial:
it acknowledges both the act (participant) and the responsibility (curator).
________________________________________
5.4 Anti-Abuse Mechanisms
PoSS includes strict protective measures:
Daily participant limits
To prevent overuse, each participant can submit only a limited number of signals per day.
Daily curator validation limits
Curators cannot validate beyond a defined threshold, preventing:
•	automated validation
•	favoritism
•	institutional overload
Daily reward caps
Regardless of signal count, a maximum daily reward can be earned.
Behavioural anomaly detection
PoSS monitors irregular patterns such as:
•	repeated identical submissions
•	coordinated attempts to inflate participation
•	sudden validation spikes
Transparent registries
All validations and signals remain public and auditable.
These mechanisms ensure PoSS remains a trustworthy, ethical, and abuse-resistant protocol.
________________________________________
5.5 Halving Mechanism (Every 8 Years)
PoSS includes a long-term reward schedule inspired by the stability principles of Bitcoin — but adapted for social participation instead of financial mining.
Every 8 years:
•	all PoSS rewards are halved
•	emission slows
•	long-term sustainability increases
Why an 8-year cycle?
•	aligns with educational, institutional and social timelines
•	encourages stability rather than short-term spikes
•	ensures token distribution lasts multiple decades
•	reinforces predictable governance
NOORCHAIN is built for generational use, not financial cycles.
________________________________________
5.6 Examples of Real-World PoSS Applications
Education
•	participation in class
•	collaborative work
•	extracurricular involvement
•	effort and behaviour recognition
Community
•	civic engagement
•	neighbourhood support
•	cultural events
•	volunteer programs
NGOs & Humanitarian Work
•	field missions
•	community development
•	logistics assistance
Every validated PoSS signal becomes part of a durable digital record of human contribution.
________________________________________
5.7 Ethical Code for Curators
Curators are the ethical layer of NOORCHAIN.
They must:
•	act impartially
•	validate only legitimate actions
•	avoid conflicts of interest
•	respect privacy
•	follow public guidelines
•	be transparent in their activity
Curators receive symbolic recognition (30% share), not financial incentive.
Their role is responsibility, not reward extraction.
________________________________________
5.8 Non-Financial Reward Philosophy
PoSS rewards are:
•	symbolic
•	capped
•	gradual
•	entirely transparent
•	disconnected from token price
•	not a source of income
•	not a financial product
•	not a yield or staking mechanism
This ensures:
•	compliance with Swiss Legal Light
•	elimination of financial risk
•	broad institutional adoption
•	protection against speculative behaviour
PoSS is not about “earning money”; it is about documenting and recognising meaningful actions.
________________________________________
6. Genesis Design — Extended Version
The Genesis Block of NOORCHAIN is not merely a technical starting point.
It represents the constitutional moment of the protocol — the codification of values, economic rules, long-term parameters, and ethical constraints that will guide the chain for decades.
Genesis defines what can change and what will never change.
It is the moment where NOORCHAIN establishes its identity:
transparent, predictable, ethical, and built for long-term institutional trust.
________________________________________
6.1 Fixed Supply Logic
NOORCHAIN adopts a permanently fixed total supply of:
299,792,458 NUR
This number is symbolic — a reference to the speed of light — but also deeply structural.
Why a fixed supply?
1. Predictable monetary environment
Institutions, schools, NGOs and communities can plan participation incentives over years without worrying about inflation.
2. Immutable economic transparency
No group can ever increase supply, manipulate issuance, or dilute participants.
3. Ethical alignment
A fixed supply prevents the creation of speculative incentives or yield-type dynamics.
4. Stability across generations
With PoSS rewards distributed slowly and predictably, the supply remains a long-term public resource.
The total supply cannot be modified by governance or code upgrades.
It is permanently encoded in the genesis and enforced by protocol rules.
________________________________________
6.2 The Allocation Model — 5 / 5 / 5 / 5 / 80
Genesis divides the entire supply into five well-defined pools, each with a precise institutional purpose.
Allocation	Percentage	Purpose
Foundation	5%	Governance, public mission, transparency
Dev (Noor Dev Sàrl)	5%	Development, infrastructure, R&D
PoSS Stimulus	5%	Onboarding curators, pilot programs
Pre-sale Reserve	5%	Optional regulated fundraising
PoSS Mintable Reserve	80%	Long-term PoSS emission
This structure is designed to mirror established Swiss blockchain foundations (e.g., Nym, Alephium, Tezos) while improving clarity and compliance.
Why this exact structure?
•	ensures no hidden team allocation
•	distributes responsibility across multiple institutions
•	protects long-term reward availability
•	guarantees transparent governance
•	prevents economic centralisation
•	supports Legal Light CH classification
This model is immutable.
No governance vote can ever modify the percentages.
________________________________________
6.3 Immutable Rules of Genesis
The Genesis includes a set of rules encoded directly into the chain logic.
These rules cannot be changed — not by governance, not by upgrades, not by multi-sig.
Immutable Structural Rules
•	Total supply is fixed forever
•	Allocation percentages (5/5/5/5/80) are permanent
•	PoSS reward split (70/30) is permanent
•	Halving occurs every 8 years
•	PoSS reserve cannot be diverted or reallocated
•	No discretionary minting is allowed
These constraints protect:
•	ethical integrity
•	legal safety
•	long-term trust
•	institutional adoption
The goal is to eliminate ambiguity and ensure NOORCHAIN remains aligned with its mission throughout its entire lifespan.
________________________________________
6.4 The Philosophy Behind Genesis
Genesis is designed not as a technical bootstrap, but as a public commitment.
It is the moment when NOORCHAIN declares:
•	its mission
•	its values
•	its supply
•	its governance constraints
•	its economic boundaries
•	its reward structure
Genesis is the “social contract” of the protocol.
It guarantees to all future participants — schools, NGOs, municipalities, institutions, and individuals — that the rules they rely on will not change unpredictably.
This stability is essential for long-term institutional adoption.
________________________________________
6.5 Predictability and Institutional Trust
NOORCHAIN is intentionally designed for communities that require:
•	reliability
•	clarity
•	durability
•	legal neutrality
Unlike financial blockchains, which evolve rapidly and sometimes unpredictably, NOORCHAIN’s Genesis sets a permanent backbone for:
•	reward timing
•	emission rates
•	governance limits
•	institutional responsibilities
This predictability is a core part of the public-good mission of the project.
________________________________________
6.6 Genesis as an Ethical Framework
The Genesis establishes ethical boundaries:
No staking
No rewards tied to financial commitment.
No investment product
No public sale, no expectation of financial gain.
No inflation
No dilution of participant or curator recognition.
No custody by the Foundation
User autonomy is preserved forever.
No override of PoSS principles
Human action remains the source of recognition.
These constraints ensure NOORCHAIN remains a social infrastructure, not a speculative asset.
________________________________________
6.7 Genesis as the Foundation for the Next 30–40 Years
With PoSS halving every 8 years and the PoSS reserve representing 80% of total supply, Genesis defines a multi-decade emission curve.
This ensures:
•	stable recognition of participation
•	long-term availability of rewards
•	durable onboarding potential
•	alignment with institutional timeframes
NOORCHAIN is designed to last for generations, not market cycles.
________________________________________
6.8 Genesis and the Social Mandate
Ultimately, the Genesis Block embodies the social mandate of NOORCHAIN:
•	reward real human actions
•	promote ethical participation
•	provide transparent public infrastructure
•	enable long-term community empowerment
•	build trust at every layer
Genesis is not a technical step.
It is the birth certificate of a new kind of blockchain — one where social value is finally measurable, recognised, and respected.
________________________________________
7. Economic Model — Extended Version
NOORCHAIN adopts an economic architecture fundamentally different from traditional blockchain systems.
It is designed to support participation, not speculation; communities, not capital; public-good ecosystems, not financial markets.
The economic model is built on five pillars:
1.	Fixed supply
2.	Non-financial utility token
3.	Institution-friendly incentives
4.	PoSS as a controlled recognition system
5.	Multi-decade sustainability
________________________________________
7.1 A Participation-Centered Economic Model
Unlike most blockchain protocols, NOORCHAIN does not reward:
•	wealth
•	hardware
•	token accumulation
•	financial risk-taking
•	liquidity provision
Instead, NOORCHAIN rewards what has long been invisible in digital systems:
verified positive human action.
The economic model recognises contribution, not capital.
This approach enables adoption by:
•	schools
•	NGOs
•	cultural institutions
•	municipalities
•	social programs
•	youth organisations
•	research institutions
NOORCHAIN functions as a public infrastructure rather than a financial platform.
________________________________________
7.2 Logic of the Fixed Supply
The total supply of 299,792,458 NUR is:
•	predetermined
•	immutable
•	transparent
•	auditable
•	resistant to manipulation
A fixed supply ensures:
1. Predictability for institutions
Partners can rely on stable, long-term rules.
2. No inflation risk
The value of participation cannot be diluted by discretionary minting.
3. Strong governance discipline
No authority can expand supply under any circumstance.
4. Ethical alignment
A stable supply supports NOORCHAIN’s non-speculative mission.
The fixed supply is a cornerstone of NOORCHAIN’s identity.
________________________________________
7.3 Halving Cycle — Every 8 Years
NOORCHAIN introduces a long-term emission rhythm inspired by Bitcoin but adapted to a social context.
Every 8 years, PoSS rewards automatically decrease by half.
Why 8 years?
•	aligns with educational, social and institutional timeframes
•	prevents short-term gaming of incentives
•	ensures multi-decade sustainability
•	supports slow, organic growth of the ecosystem
The halving cycle is structural and immutable, guaranteeing predictability for all participants.
________________________________________
7.4 Sustainable Emission Theory
The 80% PoSS reserve is emitted gradually over 25 to 40 years, depending on ecosystem activity.
The emission schedule follows four eras:
1.	Years 1–8: full reward
2.	Years 9–16: 50% reward
3.	Years 17–24: 25% reward
4.	Years 25–32: 12.5% reward
This controlled emission:
•	avoids inflation
•	avoids rapid depletion
•	stabilises participation incentives
•	encourages long-term engagement
•	maintains protocol alignment over decades
NOORCHAIN is designed for longevity, not rapid economic cycles.
________________________________________
7.5 Why PoSS Is Not a Financial Reward Mechanism
PoSS rewards are:
•	symbolic
•	capped
•	protocol-defined
•	non-financial
•	tied exclusively to validated actions
PoSS does not:
•	generate income
•	operate as staking
•	offer APR/APY
•	behave as a financial incentive
•	depend on market performance
•	require token ownership
This ensures complete alignment with Swiss Legal Light CH.
The reward represents recognition — not payment, not investment.
________________________________________
7.6 Comparison With Traditional Blockchain Models
Proof-of-Work (PoW)
Rewards hardware and energy → inaccessible for most people.
NOORCHAIN rewards human action → accessible to everyone.
Proof-of-Stake (PoS)
Rewards capital → concentration among wealthy actors.
NOORCHAIN rewards participation → egalitarian and inclusive.
DeFi Tokens
Driven by speculation and yield.
NOORCHAIN is non-speculative, mission-driven, stable.
The economic model creates an entirely new category of blockchain:
a social infrastructure chain.
________________________________________
7.7 Rejection of Financial Incentives
NOORCHAIN intentionally rejects:
•	yield farming
•	interest-bearing staking
•	liquidity mining
•	public token sales
•	speculative positioning
•	marketing language suggesting financial returns
This removes:
•	volatility
•	market manipulation risk
•	regulatory uncertainty
•	barriers to institutional adoption
The protocol remains aligned with its mission:
valorise action, not capital.
________________________________________
7.8 Community Growth Instead of Price Growth
Traditional crypto ecosystems grow when price increases.
NOORCHAIN grows when:
•	new curators join
•	more signals are validated
•	institutions adopt the system
•	communities collaborate
•	public-good initiatives expand
Growth is social, not financial.
________________________________________
7.9 Integrity Principles of the Economic Model
The economic architecture is based on five integrity rules:
1.	Predictability — rules are known, public, stable.
2.	Transparency — no hidden allocations or discretionary minting.
3.	Inclusion — no one is excluded for financial reasons.
4.	Ethics — no speculative mechanisms.
5.	Stability — long-term design resistant to market conditions.
This ensures a trustworthy foundation for institutions and communities.
________________________________________
8. Governance Framework — Extended Version
NOORCHAIN’s governance model is not designed to manage a financial ecosystem.
Its purpose is to protect the mission, preserve the integrity of the protocol, and ensure long-term stability.
The governance framework is intentionally simple, ethical, and transparent, aligned with the needs of institutions and public-good organisations.
________________________________________
8.1 Governance Philosophy
The governance of NOORCHAIN is built on four foundational principles:
1. Protect the protocol
Governance exists to safeguard the system from misuse, manipulation, or mission drift.
2. Serve the mission
All decisions must reinforce NOORCHAIN’s purpose:
recognition of positive human action through a transparent, non-financial mechanism.
3. Prevent capture
No individual, organisation, or financial actor can take control of the protocol.
4. Maintain clarity
Rules remain predictable and understandable for institutions and partners.
NOORCHAIN governance is not economic governance — it is ethical stewardship.
________________________________________
8.2 Multi-Signature Architecture
All institutional reserves (Foundation, Development, Stimulus, Pre-sale) are protected by a multi-signature (multi-sig) structure.
A 3-of-5 multi-sig ensures that:
•	no unilateral decision is possible
•	decisions reflect shared responsibility
•	financial power cannot influence control
•	transparency remains central
The multi-sig Committee includes representatives from:
•	the Foundation
•	NGOs / social sector
•	technical experts
•	legal & compliance
•	education or community partners
This composition reinforces neutrality and public accountability.
________________________________________
8.3 Immutable vs. Adjustable Parameters
NOORCHAIN makes a clear distinction between what can never change and what can adapt.
Immutable (structural)
These parameters are permanently embedded:
•	total supply
•	5/5/5/5/80 allocation
•	PoSS reward split (70/30)
•	halving every 8 years
•	Legal Light CH constraints
•	non-custodial architecture
No governance mechanism can alter these principles.
Adjustable (operational)
The following elements may evolve through governance:
•	daily PoSS limits
•	signal-type weights
•	PoSS activation/deactivation
•	module parameters
•	curator onboarding rules
This flexibility enables the system to grow while preserving its ethical core.
________________________________________
8.4 Transparency as a Governance Standard
All governance activity must be:
•	documented
•	public
•	traceable
•	archived
•	verifiable
•	consistent with the mission
Transparency builds trust among:
•	institutions
•	NGOs
•	schools
•	public entities
•	communities
NOORCHAIN treats transparency not as an option, but as a responsibility.
________________________________________
8.5 Ethical Governance Charter
Every governance actor must follow five principles:
1.	Impartiality
Decisions must prioritise public interest, not private influence.
2.	Transparency
All outcomes must be publicly accessible.
3.	Accountability
Actions must be documented and justified.
4.	Neutrality
Governance actors cannot benefit financially from their decisions.
5.	Mission Alignment
Every decision must reinforce NOORCHAIN’s purpose and Legal Light compliance.
The governance framework is an extension of NOORCHAIN’s ethical foundation.
________________________________________
8.6 Decision-Making Process
The governance process follows five predictable steps:
1.	Proposal Drafting
A proposal is written clearly and publicly.
2.	Public Review
The community, curators and institutions may comment.
3.	Discussion & Refinement
Feedback is incorporated where appropriate.
4.	Multi-sig Validation
Approval requires 3 out of 5 signatures.
5.	Publication & Archiving
Final decisions are logged permanently and transparently.
This predictable process prevents discretionary or opaque governance.
________________________________________
8.7 Anti-Capture Mechanisms
To protect the protocol from internal or external capture:
•	no voting power tied to token ownership
•	no financial incentives in governance
•	no ability to modify supply or economic rules
•	transparent multi-sig operations
•	curators serve only in advisory roles
•	immutable hard limits prevent misuse
These safeguards ensure NOORCHAIN remains independent from financial or political influence.
________________________________________
8.8 Alignment With Swiss Legal Light CH
NOORCHAIN’s governance has been designed from the ground up to meet Swiss Legal Light requirements:
•	no custody of user assets
•	no investment products
•	no financial incentives
•	no speculative governance
•	clear separation between Foundation and Sàrl
•	transparency and documentation obligations
The governance framework is inherently compliant with Swiss expectations for:
•	non-profit organisations
•	public-good digital systems
•	ethical technology platforms
________________________________________
8.9 Public Responsibility & Institutional Trust
Governance actors must maintain:
•	high ethical standards
•	public accountability
•	mission-driven decision-making
•	consistent alignment with non-financial principles
Institutions must be able to trust NOORCHAIN for decades.
The governance model is built to ensure that trust.
________________________________________
9. Security Model — Extended Version
NOORCHAIN’s security model is built on the principle that a blockchain designed for social and institutional use must be technically robust, socially resilient, and legally safe.
Security is therefore multi-layered:
•	technical security
•	social validation security
•	economic immutability
•	governance safeguards
•	transparency defence mechanisms
The goal is not to defend financial assets — NOORCHAIN is non-custodial — but to protect integrity, fairness, and long-term trust.
________________________________________
9.1 Threat Landscape Overview
NOORCHAIN operates in a hybrid environment:
real human actions + on-chain validation + institutional actors.
It therefore faces three categories of threats:
1. Social Abuse
•	fabricated signals
•	collusion between participants and curators
•	mass submission of fake contributions
•	institutional misuse
•	identity or role misrepresentation
2. Technical Attacks
•	module exploitation
•	smart contract misuse (EVM compatibility)
•	validator misbehaviour
•	governance parameter misuse
•	chain halting or congestion attempts
3. Economic & Governance Risks
•	attempts to manipulate PoSS distribution
•	unauthorised minting requests
•	governance capture by coordinated actors
•	misinformation or opaque decision-making
The security model anticipates and mitigates all three dimensions.
________________________________________
9.2 Social Risk Mitigation
Social signals come from real-world actions, which introduces unique challenges.
NOORCHAIN addresses them through:
Daily Limits
Each participant and curator is subject to strict daily signal caps, preventing farming and mass generation.
Reward Caps
A daily reward ceiling ensures the system cannot be exploited for rapid accumulation.
Curator Oversight
Curators are identifiable on-chain and accountable through:
•	public validation logs
•	ethical guidelines
•	potential audits by the Foundation
•	transparent participation records
No Financial Incentive for Curators
Because curators do not profit financially:
•	collusion is disincentivised
•	validation decisions remain ethical
•	operational misuse loses most of its motivation
Real-World Institutional Anchoring
Curators are typically:
•	schools
•	NGOs
•	community organisations
Their reputational interest — not financial interest — reinforces reliability.
________________________________________
9.3 Technical Security Architecture
NOORCHAIN uses a proven base:
•	Cosmos SDK for modularity
•	Ethermint for EVM compatibility
•	CometBFT consensus
Key technical defences include:
Module Isolation
PoSS is isolated in its own module (x/noorsignal), limiting cross-module risk.
Parameter Governance
Only non-critical parameters are adjustable.
Structural rules are hard-coded and cannot be overridden.
Safe Minting Logic
Minting is possible only through controlled PoSS functions:
•	validated signals
•	adherence to daily limits
•	halving-based reward calculation
•	transparent 70/30 split
No external module can mint tokens.
Consensus Security
Validators operate under the robust security guarantees of CometBFT:
•	deterministic finality
•	fork protection
•	accountability of validators
•	double-signing penalties (slashing)
EVM Safety
The EVM execution environment is sandboxed:
•	contract execution limits
•	gas boundaries
•	isolation from PoSS logic
•	predictable, non-financial use cases
NOORCHAIN does not run DeFi applications, eliminating an entire class of attack vectors.
________________________________________
9.4 Governance Safeguards
NOORCHAIN protects itself from governance misuse through:
Multi-sig Enforcement
All allocation addresses are controlled by a 3/5 multi-sig.
No single actor can:
•	redirect funds
•	modify PoSS parameters
•	execute upgrades
•	misuse institutional reserves
Immutable Boundaries
Governance can never modify:
•	fixed supply
•	PoSS 70/30 split
•	5/5/5/5/80 allocation
•	halving schedule
•	Legal Light restrictions
These immutables form a security perimeter.
Public Decision Records
Every governance action must be:
•	published
•	documented
•	archived
This visibility prevents hidden manipulation.
________________________________________
9.5 Economic Security (Non-Financial Design)
NOORCHAIN is fundamentally non-financial:
•	no staking
•	no APR
•	no speculative rewards
•	no liquidity pools
•	no treasury yield mechanics
This drastically reduces:
•	economic attack vectors
•	incentive misalignment
•	rug-pull risks
•	wealth-driven governance attacks
The economic model itself becomes a layer of security, because attackers cannot profit financially from exploitation.
________________________________________
9.6 Transparency as a Structural Defence
In NOORCHAIN, transparency is a security feature.
Public visibility ensures:
•	curators are accountable
•	governance is traceable
•	PoSS logic is reviewable
•	allocations are publicly known
•	institutional partners can verify systems
Opaque behaviour becomes immediately detectable.
This transparency reinforces social trust and institutional adoption.
________________________________________
9.7 Immutable Rules as Security Guarantees
The following immutables are part of NOORCHAIN’s core defence:
•	fixed supply (299,792,458 NUR)
•	halving every 8 years
•	PoSS distribution limited to 80% reserve
•	70/30 structural split
•	no inflation
•	no discretionary minting
These rules protect the system against:
•	mission drift
•	inflation abuse
•	manipulation of value
•	economic takeover attempts
Security is therefore not only technical — it is economic and ethical by design.
________________________________________
9.8 Regulatory Compatibility as Security
NOORCHAIN’s adherence to Swiss Legal Light CH standards ensures:
•	reduced legal risk
•	institutional trust
•	long-term sustainability
•	avoidance of financial-system attacks
•	clear operational boundaries
By design, NOORCHAIN avoids:
•	financial custody
•	investor conflicts
•	speculative incentives
•	complex regulatory burdens
This legal clarity acts as a security buffer.
________________________________________
9.9 Summary
NOORCHAIN’s security relies on:
•	robust Cosmos/EVM module design
•	strict governance protections
•	PoSS limits and controls
•	real-world institutional roles
•	immutability of economic rules
•	transparency of all processes
It creates a secure, predictable, and ethical environment suitable for:
•	schools
•	NGOs
•	public institutions
•	cultural organisations
•	community programs
Security is not a bolt-on element — it is woven throughout the architecture, economics, governance, and social model of NOORCHAIN.

•	it avoids regulatory exposure
NOORCHAIN is not a marketplace.
It is a digital public infrastructure for recognising contribution at scale.
________________________________________
11. Ecosystem Vision — Extended Version
NOORCHAIN is more than a blockchain.
It is the foundation of a new social digital ecosystem — one that recognises, structures, and amplifies human contribution without ever relying on financial incentives.
This vision is long-term, institution-friendly, ethically anchored, and aligned with public-good values.
The ecosystem evolves around five core components:
1.	Curators Hub
2.	CCN Studio (Community Content Network)
3.	Local Community Tools
4.	Institutional Integrations
5.	A Non-Speculative, Participation-Based Digital Economy
________________________________________
11.1 Curators Hub — The Social Integrity Layer
The Curators Hub is the operational heart of NOORCHAIN’s social validation model.
It provides curators — NGOs, educators, community leaders, cultural actors — with a structured interface to:
•	view incoming signals
•	validate or reject actions
•	collaborate with other curators
•	follow ethical guidelines
•	maintain public accountability
Why it matters
The Curators Hub ensures:
•	legitimacy of PoSS
•	protection against misuse
•	public confidence
•	alignment between institutions and the protocol
It serves as the social governance layer of NOORCHAIN, independent from financial incentives.
________________________________________
11.2 CCN Studio — The Creative and Cultural Layer
The CCN Studio (Community Content Network) is where communities create, document, and certify meaningful content.
It enables:
•	creation of educational and cultural content
•	certification of contributions through PoSS
•	documentation of social or community initiatives
•	collaborative projects across institutions
Strategic role in the ecosystem
CCN Studio empowers communities to:
•	express identity
•	build collective narratives
•	document achievements
•	contribute creatively to public-good objectives
It enriches NOORCHAIN with a cultural dimension, extending its impact beyond simple validation mechanics.
________________________________________
11.3 Local Community Tools — Infrastructure for Municipal and Social Projects
Local governments, cultural institutions, and community centres often lack unified digital infrastructures for participation.
NOORCHAIN enables them to build:
•	community dashboards
•	event participation trackers
•	volunteer program tools
•	cultural activity validation systems
•	intergenerational engagement platforms
Impact
These tools make NOORCHAIN a local digital public service, not a technical curiosity.
They support:
•	inclusivity
•	civic engagement
•	cultural development
•	community resilience
________________________________________
11.4 Institutional Integrations — APIs and Data Interfaces
Institutions worldwide can integrate NOORCHAIN without advanced technical expertise.
The ecosystem includes:
•	public APIs
•	dashboards
•	validation systems
•	analytics modules
These tools allow NGOs, schools, cultural institutions, municipalities, and associations to plug into NOORCHAIN seamlessly.
Benefits for institutions
•	interoperable digital recognition
•	transparent contribution records
•	ethical compliance (no financial element)
•	long-term sustainability
•	adaptable workflows
NOORCHAIN becomes a neutral institutional backbone for recognising human contribution.
________________________________________
11.5 A Non-Speculative Digital Economy Based on Participation
NOORCHAIN rejects traditional token-economic models:
•	no staking
•	no APR
•	no yield farming
•	no liquidity mining
•	no financial promises
•	no DeFi mechanism
Instead, it creates an economy of participation with the following characteristics:
1. Fixed Supply
Predictability and long-term institutional trust.
2. PoSS-Based Distribution
Rewards tied only to human contribution and ethical validation.
3. Halving Cycle (8 Years)
Multi-decade sustainability and strategic visibility.
4. 70/30 Structural Split
Immutable fairness: 70% participant, 30% curator.
5. Non-Financial Motivation
Contribution becomes a recognised digital asset, not a financial one.
NOORCHAIN’s economy is slow, stable, ethical, and mission-driven — a stark contrast to speculative blockchain environments.
________________________________________
11.6 Multi-Decade Vision
NOORCHAIN is designed to grow in phases, not in hype cycles.
Its long-term vision spans decades, supported by:
•	an 8-year halving cycle
•	institutional partnerships
•	community-led adoption
•	integration into public-good initiatives
•	transparent governance
Why multi-decade?
Because social infrastructure evolves slowly:
•	education reforms
•	municipal programs
•	NGO development
•	cultural strategies
•	community initiatives
NOORCHAIN aligns with these natural institutional rhythms.
________________________________________
11.7 A New Category of Digital Infrastructure
NOORCHAIN is not:
•	a financial product
•	a speculative platform
•	a traditional blockchain
•	a token economy
•	a tech startup
It represents a new category:
A Social Contribution Infrastructure Layer.
It measures what has always been present but never quantified:
•	civic engagement
•	collective action
•	educational effort
•	cultural participation
•	social contribution
This transforms NOORCHAIN into a public-good digital infrastructure, stable, neutral, and built for institutions.
________________________________________
12. Roadmap — Long Version
NOORCHAIN’s roadmap has been designed to be realistic, ethical, and institution-oriented, progressing through a series of carefully structured phases.
Each phase is aligned with:
•	Legal Light Switzerland
•	institutional adoption standards
•	non-financial architecture

•	cross-border collaborations
NOORCHAIN aims to become a durable global reference for ethical digital participation.
________________________________________
13. Comparative Analysis — Extended Version
NOORCHAIN introduces a fundamentally new category of blockchain infrastructure.
To fully understand its position in the global landscape, it is essential to compare it with existing technological models and to highlight what differentiates NOORCHAIN from:
•	Proof-of-Work blockchains
•	Proof-of-Stake blockchains
•	Social tokens and reputation systems
•	Financial and speculative blockchain ecosystems
This comparative analysis shows how NOORCHAIN relies on participation, not capital, creating a non-financial, human-centered protocol.
________________________________________
13.1 Proof-of-Work (PoW) vs. NOORCHAIN
Proof-of-Work blockchains, such as Bitcoin, reward participants based on computational power.
The underlying principle is:
He who owns the most hardware wins.
Strengths of PoW
•	long-term security
•	predictable issuance model
•	transparent economic rules
•	decentralised validator model
Limitations of PoW
•	high energy consumption
•	expensive hardware requirements
•	technical barriers to entry
•	rewards accessible only to capital-intensive actors
Comparison Table
Criteria	Proof-of-Work	NOORCHAIN
Reward Basis	Computational power	Verified human action
Accessibility	Low	Very high
Energy Use	High	Minimal
Inclusivity	Low	Universal
Participation Model	Financial / technical	Social / human
What NOORCHAIN Changes
NOORCHAIN keeps the predictability of Bitcoin’s emission model (halving),
but removes all financial or computational barriers, replacing them with ethical and verified social contribution.
________________________________________
13.2 Proof-of-Stake (PoS) vs. NOORCHAIN
In Proof-of-Stake systems, influence is proportional to capital:
The more tokens you hold, the more power you gain.
Strengths of PoS
•	energy-efficient
•	high throughput
•	widely adopted
Limitations of PoS
•	favour the wealthy
•	encourages speculation
•	risk of governance capture
•	rewards are tied to financial power
•	speculative ecosystems around staking yields
Comparison Table
Criteria	Proof-of-Stake	NOORCHAIN
Entry Requirement	Capital ownership	No financial barrier
Reward Model	Passive income (APR/APY)	Recognition of positive action
Governance Power	Proportional to wealth	Not tied to token ownership
Centralisation Risk	High	Very low
Legal Complexity	High	Low (Legal Light CH compliant)
What NOORCHAIN Changes
NOORCHAIN removes the role of wealth completely.
Its rewards have no link to finance and its governance cannot be captured by wealthy stakeholders.
This makes it suitable for:
•	schools
•	municipalities
•	NGOs
•	cultural institutions
•	social programs
PoS ecosystems cannot safely serve these environments.
________________________________________
13.3 Social Tokens & Reputation Systems vs. NOORCHAIN
Many projects attempt to tokenise personal reputation or social value, but they typically:
•	rely on subjective evaluation
•	create speculative markets around human activity
•	suffer from governance ambiguity
•	lack institutional alignment
Weaknesses of social-token models
•	risk of exploitation or favouritism
•	unclear legal classification
•	market volatility attached to personal identity
•	lack of structured validation
•	potential ethical conflicts
How NOORCHAIN differs
NOORCHAIN solves these issues by:
•	removing financial markets entirely
•	using institutional curators, not subjective voters
•	basing value on real actions, never popularity
•	relying on immutable rules, not opinion
•	ensuring strict Legal Light compliance
NOORCHAIN is not a “social token” — it is a social infrastructure.
________________________________________
13.4 Financial Blockchains vs. NOORCHAIN
Most blockchains operate within a financial logic:
•	DeFi
•	staking
•	yield farming
•	liquidity pools
•	speculative markets
These create systemic risks:
•	economic volatility
•	market manipulation
•	regulatory exposure
•	accessibility limits
•	concentration of power
Why NOORCHAIN avoids financial mechanisms
•	no staking
•	no APY/APR
•	no liquidity mining
•	no internal DEX
•	no yield products
•	no inflation
This allows NOORCHAIN to remain:
•	non-speculative
•	legally safe
•	accessible
•	trustable
•	suitable for public institutions
________________________________________
13.5 Systemic Risks of Traditional Models
Traditional blockchain models (PoW, PoS, DeFi) introduce risks unsuitable for NGOs, schools, governments, or cultural institutions:
•	hyper-volatility
•	financial conflicts of interest
•	governance captured by wealthy actors
•	complex regulatory obligations
•	security issues related to DeFi contracts
•	susceptibility to economic attacks
NOORCHAIN is explicitly designed to avoid these risks entirely, making it stable enough for institutional and public-good environments.
________________________________________
13.6 How NOORCHAIN Addresses These Risks
1. Fixed Supply
No inflation = long-term predictability.
2. Halving Cycle (8 years)
Slow, stable emission = institutional compatibility.
3. 70/30 PoSS Split
Hard-coded fairness.
4. Multi-sig Governance
Protection from unilateral decisions.
5. No Yield Model
Removes financial incentive attacks.
6. Non-custodial by design
No regulatory exposure to financial law.
7. Transparency
All rules are public, auditable, immutable.
8. Separation of Powers
Foundation / Sàrl / Curators — each with defined, non-overlapping roles.
Together, these create a blockchain that is:
•	ethically aligned
•	institutionally safe
•	socially meaningful
•	long-term sustainable
________________________________________
13.7 A New Category: Social Contribution Infrastructure
NOORCHAIN is not:
•	a competitor to Bitcoin
•	a new staking ecosystem
•	a DeFi platform
•	a social token economy
•	a financial product
It establishes an entirely new category:
A non-financial blockchain dedicated to recognising human contribution.
This makes NOORCHAIN uniquely positioned to serve:
•	educational networks
•	NGOs and humanitarian missions
•	municipalities and civic programs
•	cultural institutions
•	youth initiatives
•	academic research collaborations
•	public-good infrastructure projects
________________________________________
14. Legal & Compliance Summary — Extended Version
NOORCHAIN has been designed from its inception to operate within a safe, transparent, and institution-compatible legal framework.
Its non-financial architecture makes it uniquely suited for schools, NGOs, municipalities, cultural institutions, and public-good projects.
This section summarises the legal principles, compliance guarantees, and structural protections that make NOORCHAIN a Swiss Legal Light blockchain.
________________________________________
14.1 Core Principles of the Swiss “Legal Light” Framework
A blockchain project qualifies as Legal Light in Switzerland when it satisfies the following conditions:
1. No promise of financial return
NOORCHAIN:
•	does not offer yield
•	does not offer staking rewards
•	does not promote any form of income
•	does not create financial expectations
2. No investment product
NUR is not intended for:
•	investment
•	speculation
•	passive revenue
•	appreciation incentives
NUR is strictly a utility token used for participation and dApps.
3. No custody of user assets
NOORCHAIN never:
•	stores user funds
•	manages private keys
•	processes transactions on behalf of users
•	offers wallet recovery
Users remain fully responsible for their assets at all times.
4. No internal fiat conversion
Fiat exchange is strictly external, through regulated PSPs such as:
•	Mt Pelerin
•	NOWPayments
NOORCHAIN never touches user fiat or crypto in a custodial manner.
5. Full transparency
All:
•	rules,
•	parameters,
•	immutabilities,
•	governance limits
are made public and are part of the Genesis Pack.
6. Clear organisational separation
•	NOORCHAIN Foundation → non-profit governance
•	Noor Dev Sàrl → operational development
•	Curators → validation of social signals
This three-layer structure prevents conflicts of interest.
________________________________________
14.2 Absence of Financial Promises
NOORCHAIN intentionally avoids all financial language.
It does not claim:
•	profit
•	dividends
•	interest
•	gains
•	APY/APR
•	“passive income”
•	price appreciation
PoSS rewards are:
•	symbolic,
•	capped,
•	slow,
•	non-financial,
•	independent of market dynamics,
•	tied exclusively to verified social actions.
This positioning is key to Legal Light CH compliance.
________________________________________
14.3 Non-Custodial Architecture
NOORCHAIN does not hold, store, or manage any user assets.
User responsibilities (explicit)
Users are solely responsible for:
•	their private keys
•	their wallets
•	managing and securing access
•	interacting with the blockchain
Foundation responsibilities (limited)
The Foundation:
•	does not recover lost accounts
•	does not operate wallets
•	does not interact with user funds
•	does not process or hold any currency
This strict separation guarantees regulatory clarity.
________________________________________
14.4 No Public Sale
There is no ICO, no token sale, and no public fundraising round.
The 5% pre-sale allocation is:
•	optional
•	private
•	limited to Swiss-compliant frameworks
•	intended for institutional, philanthropic or impact-oriented partners
•	subject to strict vesting
•	controlled through multi-sig
•	never open to the general public
This is fully aligned with Swiss financial guidelines.
________________________________________
14.5 Mandatory Transparency Requirements
To maintain institutional trust, NOORCHAIN commits to:
•	public documentation
•	public governance records
•	public parameters
•	public genesis allocations
•	public multi-sig disclosures
All critical elements are versioned and archived.
This transparency is a fundamental compliance pillar.
________________________________________
14.6 Architectural Features Supporting Compliance
Every layer of NOORCHAIN’s technical design reduces legal risk:
1. Fixed Supply
→ prevents discretionary minting and financial manipulation.
2. Immutable allocations
→ ensures no privileged redistribution.
3. No staking or yield mechanisms
→ eliminates classification as an investment product.
4. Controlled PoSS mint
→ rewards are predictable, slow and capped.
5. Multi-sig structure
→ prevents unilateral control.
6. Non-financial token utility
→ used only for participation, dApps, and governance interactions.
7. No market dependency
→ PoSS does not rely on token price or liquidity.
________________________________________
14.7 Legal Safety for Institutions (NGOs, Schools, Municipalities)
Because NOORCHAIN is non-financial, institutions can safely adopt it without:
•	banking licenses
•	financial supervision
•	investment disclaimers
•	volatility exposure
•	custodial risk
•	speculative association
NGOs can use it for:
•	volunteer validation
•	transparent reporting
Schools can use it for:
•	participation tracking
•	educational programs
Municipalities can use it for:
•	civic engagement
•	community projects
This institutional compatibility differentiates NOORCHAIN from nearly all blockchain models.
________________________________________
14.8 Regulatory Alignment Summary
Regulation Area	Status	Notes
Financial product classification	Not applicable	No yield, no sale, no speculation
Custody rules	Fully compliant	Users hold their own keys
PSP regulation	Not applicable	No fiat or crypto handling
Investment law	Fully compliant	Pre-sale strictly controlled
Transparency obligations	Exceeded	Public governance & parameters
ESG alignment	Strong	Human-centred, low-energy, inclusive
________________________________________
14.9 Long-Term Legal Stability
Because NOORCHAIN:
•	never becomes a financial platform
•	has immutable, public rules
•	uses symbolic recognition rather than economic incentives
it is resilient to future regulatory changes.
NOORCHAIN is built to remain legally valid for decades.
________________________________________
14.10 Conclusion of the Compliance Section
NOORCHAIN provides a legally safe, transparent, and institutionally compliant blockchain model.
It avoids all speculative mechanisms and embraces an ethical, predictable architecture aligned with Swiss standards.
This makes NOORCHAIN one of the few blockchains that can be safely used by:
•	public institutions
•	NGOs
•	schools
•	municipalities
•	cultural organisations
•	research institutions
without regulatory risk.

15. Annexes — Extended Version
The annexes provide complementary material to support institutional readers, technical reviewers, and governance bodies in understanding how NOORCHAIN operates at conceptual, operational, and regulatory levels.
They are intentionally concise, neutral, and non-financial.
________________________________________
15.1 Glossary of Core Concepts
PoSS — Proof of Social Signal
The protocol mechanism through which NOORCHAIN recognises positive human actions submitted by participants and validated by curators.
It is not mining, staking, or a financial yield system.
Signal
A digital representation of a real-world action or contribution (e.g., participation, assistance, collaboration).
Signals follow a full lifecycle: submission → validation → reward calculation → immutable archive.
Curator
An authorised validator responsible for reviewing and approving or rejecting signals.
Curators represent institutions such as schools, NGOs, community organisations, or cultural entities.
Halving
Automatic halving of PoSS raw rewards every 8 years.
Ensures long-term sustainability of the 80% PoSS Mintable Reserve.
Genesis
The first block of the blockchain containing immutable rules such as:
•	fixed supply
•	allocation model (5/5/5/5/80)
•	halving schedule
•	structural PoSS split (70/30)
•	foundational governance parameters
Fixed Supply
A permanent cap of 299,792,458 NUR.
No inflation and no discretionary minting are ever possible.
Legal Light (Switzerland)
A compliance approach avoiding:
•	financial products
•	investment promotion
•	custody of user assets
•	public token sales
•	yield or return mechanisms
Ensures institutional safety and regulatory clarity.

15.2 Examples of Valid Signals (Illustrative Only)
These examples demonstrate how NOORCHAIN can support a wide spectrum of social, educational, cultural, and humanitarian contributions.
Education
•	Active participation during class
•	Completion of collaborative projects
•	Academic involvement or tutoring
•	Contributions to school community events
Community & Civic Engagement
•	Attendance and participation in local initiatives
•	Support for municipal cultural programs

•	Structured support for community programs
•	Training, workshops, or awareness campaigns
Cultural & Artistic Activities
•	Participation in public events
•	Contributions to artistic workshops
•	Support for cultural organisations
These examples illustrate the universality and neutrality of the PoSS model.
________________________________________
15.3 Curator Ethical Charter (Concise Institutional Version)
Curators must operate with responsibility and impartiality.
They commit to:
Integrity
•	Validate only legitimate, real-world actions
•	Reject any signal that appears manipulated or inconsistent
Neutrality
•	Avoid conflicts of interest
•	Apply uniform standards regardless of participant identity
Transparency
•	Maintain clear, consistent validation activity
•	Uphold NOORCHAIN’s public mission and ethical values
Responsibility
•	Understand the implications of incorrect validation
•	Protect the integrity of the PoSS reward cycle
Curators are moral stewards of NOORCHAIN’s human-centred mission.
________________________________________
15.4 Governance Process Overview (Institutional Workflow)
A standard governance decision follows five predictable stages:
1.	Proposal Drafting
A clear, documented request is formulated and published.
2.	Public Disclosure
The proposal is shared for open consultation.
3.	Discussion & Review
Stakeholders and the community may comment or suggest improvements.
4.	Validation Through Multi-sig
The 3/5 Foundation Multi-sig executes the approved action.
5.	Archival & Documentation
The decision, rationale, and outcome are added to public governance records.
This workflow ensures transparency, predictability, and institutional trust.
