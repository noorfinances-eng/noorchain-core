This document is provided for informational purposes only. It describes the mission, principles, and design of the NOORCHAIN protocol. It does not constitute financial advice, investment guidance, a prospectus, or a solicitation of any kind. NOORCHAIN is a non-financial, non-custodial blockchain protocol operating under Swiss Legal-Light CH principles. The NUR token is a utility instrument and is not positioned as a financial asset or investment product.
1. Introduction
NOORCHAIN is a Swiss-based ethical blockchain designed to recognise and validate positive human actions. While most blockchain systems reward financial capital, stake, or computational power, NOORCHAIN introduces a different paradigm: value emerges from verified social participation rather than financial resources. The protocol is intentionally non-financial, non-custodial, transparent, and aligned with Swiss Legal-Light CH principles. It is designed for institutions, NGOs, educators, municipalities, and communities that require a neutral and reliable digital infrastructure. The objective of NOORCHAIN is deliberately simple: to provide a long-term, transparent participation ledger that institutions and communities can trust.
2. Vision
Most digital systems today reward economic capital, attention capture, or technical dominance. NOORCHAIN shifts this dynamic by recognising human engagement as a measurable, verifiable, and meaningful contribution. The vision of the project is to build a global infrastructure where positive social actions can be acknowledged ethically and transparently, without speculation or financial incentives. NOORCHAIN encourages participation, responsibility, community involvement, and social contribution through recognition rather than monetary reward.
3. What Makes NOORCHAIN Distinct
NOORCHAIN introduces a set of foundational principles that clearly differentiate it from financial or speculative blockchain systems. At its core is Proof of Social Signal (PoSS), a protocol mechanism that allows real and positive human actions to be validated by trusted institutions. The protocol operates with a fixed supply of 299,792,458 NUR tokens, defined at genesis and never expandable. PoSS recognition follows an immutable 70/30 structural split between participants and curators, encoded at the protocol level and not subject to governance discretion. Emission follows a slow and predictable eight-year halving cycle designed for sustainability and intergenerational use. NOORCHAIN deliberately excludes staking yields, APR or APY mechanisms, and financial promises. It is built as an institution-ready infrastructure focused on transparency, reliability, and ethical interaction. NOORCHAIN is not a financial product; it is a public participation infrastructure.
4. The Role of PoSS (Proof of Social Signal)
PoSS transforms positive human actions into verifiable on-chain signals validated by trusted curators. A signal may represent class participation, volunteer work, involvement in community projects, engagement in cultural or social activities, or contributions to public and educational programs. Curators, such as schools, NGOs, educators, or institutions, validate these signals according to ethical and transparent criteria. Recognition under PoSS is symbolic and non-financial. It is protocol-controlled, strictly capped by the PoSS reserve, and never linked to staking, deposits, or yield. PoSS functions as a social recognition system, not as a financial incentive mechanism. It does not secure the blockchain and is not a consensus layer; it operates strictly at the application level.
5. Economic Model
NOORCHAIN follows a transparent and immutable economic model designed for public-good infrastructure rather than financial optimisation. The protocol is built around a fixed and predictable supply, clear allocation rules, and the absence of speculative mechanisms. Its economic architecture is intended to support long-term institutional use, not market-driven dynamics.
5.1 Fixed Supply
The total supply of the NUR token is fixed at 299,792,458 units, a symbolic reference to the speed of light and the principles of clarity and transparency. This supply is encoded at genesis and cannot be altered. There is no inflation, no discretionary minting, and no token creation beyond the predefined PoSS reserve. This fixed-supply design provides predictability and stability for institutions and communities using the protocol.
5.2 Genesis Allocation
The genesis allocation follows a clear and immutable structure. Five percent of the supply is allocated to the Foundation to support governance, transparency, documentation, and institutional partnerships. Five percent is allocated to the technical development entity (Swiss Sàrl) to ensure maintenance, research, and long-term technical sustainability. Five percent is reserved for PoSS stimulus to support early institutional adoption, pilots, and ecosystem activation. Five percent may be allocated to a regulated and optional pre-sale, limited to Swiss and institutional contexts and subject to vesting, if activated. The remaining eighty percent is reserved for long-term PoSS emission across multiple eras. These allocation values are protocol-defined and cannot be modified by governance.
5.3 Absence of Speculative Features
NOORCHAIN deliberately excludes mechanisms commonly associated with speculative blockchain systems. There is no staking yield, no APR or APY, no protocol-operated liquidity pools, no farming or lock-up incentives, and no investment-oriented reward structures. This exclusion ensures alignment with Swiss Legal-Light CH principles and protects institutions from financial and reputational risk.
6. Curators: Guardians of Integrity
Curators are trusted entities drawn from the social and institutional ecosystem, including NGOs, schools, educators, social institutions, cultural organisations, associations, and community groups. Their role is not financial but ethical and mission-oriented. Curators validate real human actions, ensure fairness in recognition, and help prevent misuse of the protocol. They do not receive financial benefits, do not control protocol governance, and do not manage user assets. Curators are central to the integrity and legitimacy of PoSS, acting as accountable validators of social participation.
7. Technology Overview
NOORCHAIN is implemented as a sovereign Layer 1 blockchain with native EVM compatibility. The architecture is intentionally conservative and institution-friendly. It is designed to be predictable, auditable, and stable over long periods of time. The protocol avoids complex DeFi logic, custodial layers, and yield engineering. Its technical design prioritises clarity, security, and long-term operability. NOORCHAIN is intended to function as a public digital ledger for participation, not as a financial execution environment.
8. Legal and Compliance Foundations
NOORCHAIN is designed to operate within the Swiss Legal-Light CH framework. It is non-custodial and does not hold private keys or user funds. It does not constitute a financial product, investment offering, or speculative instrument. The protocol includes no yield mechanisms, no financial remuneration, and no investment messaging. Governance processes, documentation, and core parameters are transparent and publicly accessible. These principles ensure that NOORCHAIN can be safely adopted by public institutions, NGOs, educators, municipalities, and community programs without regulatory exposure.
9. Use Cases
NOORCHAIN is designed as a neutral and durable participation ledger applicable across multiple social and institutional contexts. In education, it enables participation tracking, recognition of student effort, validation of extracurricular activities, and transparent engagement records over time. For NGOs and humanitarian projects, it provides verification of volunteer participation, transparent contribution logs, and reliable measurement of community involvement. Within communities and municipalities, NOORCHAIN supports civic engagement tracking, cultural participation reporting, and validation of collaborative public projects. Cultural institutions can use the protocol to document event participation, measure cultural engagement, and provide transparent reporting for public programs. Across all use cases, NOORCHAIN functions as a non-financial infrastructure focused on recognition rather than remuneration.
10. Governance Principles
NOORCHAIN governance is designed to ensure stability, neutrality, and long-term clarity. A non-profit Foundation safeguards the public-good mission, ensures legal alignment, and maintains transparency and documentation. A multi-signature committee executes governance-approved actions within strict boundaries and cannot modify supply, PoSS rules, or economic invariants. Curators hold an advisory and validation role without treasury control or governance authority. Core protocol rules are immutable, including fixed supply, the 70/30 PoSS recognition structure, the eight-year halving schedule, the genesis allocation framework, and Legal-Light CH constraints. Governance processes are transparent, documented, and strictly non-financial.
11. Long-Term Vision
NOORCHAIN aims to become a global reference infrastructure for digital participation records, ethical recognition systems, community engagement metrics, and transparent validation tools. Its architecture—based on fixed supply, multi-era PoSS emission, and institutional neutrality—is designed for longevity rather than short-term adoption cycles. The protocol is intended to serve as a stable digital platform for public-interest use cases across generations.
12. Conclusion
NOORCHAIN introduces a distinct category of blockchain infrastructure: a human-centered, ethical, and non-financial participation protocol. By recognising positive actions through transparent and responsible mechanisms, NOORCHAIN provides a durable foundation for communities, educators, institutions, and public organisations worldwide. It is designed for public good, ethical technology, and long-term trust—rather than speculation or financial incentives.
