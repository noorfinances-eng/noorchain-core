NOORCHAIN — Public Whitepaper 1.1
A Human-Centered Blockchain for Social Participation
Version 1.1 — Public Edition
Last Updated: 08.12.2025
________________________________________
1. Introduction
NOORCHAIN is a Swiss-based, ethical blockchain designed to recognize and validate positive human actions.
While traditional blockchains reward financial power, NOORCHAIN introduces a new paradigm: value created through verified social participation.
The protocol is non-financial, non-custodial and fully aligned with Swiss Legal Light guidelines.
Its objective is simple: provide a neutral, transparent and long-term digital infrastructure that institutions, educators, NGOs and communities can trust.

2. Vision
Modern digital systems often reward capital or computing power.
NOORCHAIN shifts this dynamic by recognizing human engagement as a measurable, verifiable and meaningful contribution.
Vision Statement:
To build the first global infrastructure where positive social actions create value in a transparent, ethical and verifiable way.
The protocol encourages participation, responsibility and community involvement — without speculation or financial incentives.

3. What Makes NOORCHAIN Unique
NOORCHAIN introduces several foundational innovations:
•	Proof of Signal Social (PoSS) — A mechanism that validates real human actions.
•	Fixed Supply — 299,792,458 NUR (no inflation, no additional minting).
•	Ethical Reward Split — 70% to the participant, 30% to the curator (immutable).
•	Halving Every 8 Years — A slow, predictable and durable emission schedule.
•	Non-speculative Design — No staking yield, no APR/APY, no financial promises.
•	Institution-ready — Built for NGOs, schools, communities and cultural institutions.
NOORCHAIN is not a financial product.
It is an institutional protocol that brings visibility to human participation.

4. The Role of PoSS (Proof of Signal Social)
PoSS is the heart of NOORCHAIN.
It transforms positive actions into verifiable on-chain signals, validated by trusted curators.
A “signal” can represent:
•	participation in class
•	volunteer work
•	contribution to a community project
•	involvement in cultural or social activities
Curators (teachers, NGOs, institutions) validate signals ethically and transparently.
Rewards are symbolic, non-financial and protocol-controlled.

5. Economic Model
NOORCHAIN follows a transparent and immutable economic model.
5.1 Fixed Supply
299,792,458 NUR — inspired by the speed of light.
No inflation. No discretionary minting.
5.2 Genesis Allocation (5/5/5/5/80)
•	5% Foundation
•	5% Development
•	5% PoSS Stimulus
•	5% Pre-sale (optional, regulated)
•	80% PoSS Reserve
Only PoSS can gradually distribute the reserve, over several decades.
5.3 No Speculation Features
NOORCHAIN does not provide:
•	staking yield
•	financial returns
•	investment products
•	farming mechanisms
This structure ensures strict Legal Light compatibility.

6. Curators: Guardians of Integrity
Curators are community-trusted actors:
•	NGOs
•	schools
•	educators
•	social institutions
•	cultural organizations
They do not receive financial benefits.
Their role is to maintain ethical standards, validate real actions and protect the protocol from abuse.
Curators reinforce the social mission of NOORCHAIN.

7. Technology Overview
NOORCHAIN is built on:
•	Cosmos SDK — modular, transparent, secure
•	Ethermint (EVM) — allowing future institutional tools
•	PoSS Module — custom, auditable and parameter-driven
The architecture is intentionally simple:
•	predictable
•	long-term
•	auditable
•	designed for low-risk institutional adoption
There is no DeFi, no custodial layer and no financial engineering.

•	non-custodial
•	no financial products
•	no investment offering

•	Curators — advisory, validation role
•	Immutable Protocol Rules — supply, 70/30, halving, allocations
Governance is transparent, documented and strictly non-financial.
