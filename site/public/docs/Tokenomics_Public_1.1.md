Tokenomics — Version 1.1 (Public Release)

NOORCHAIN — Tokenomics Overview
Version 1.1 — Public Documentation
Last Updated: 08.12.2025

1. Introduction
NOORCHAIN is a Swiss-built, institution-oriented blockchain protocol designed around transparency, non-custodial usage, and long-term sustainability.
NOORCHAIN 2.1 operates as a sovereign EVM Layer-1, secured by a permissioned BFT consensus for deterministic finality and operational accountability.
The protocol includes an application-layer mechanism called Proof of Signal Social (PoSS), designed to structure and recognise verified positive human actions through curator accountability. PoSS is not consensus and does not contribute to chain security; it is a separate recognition and governance layer whose outputs can be committed on-chain for auditability.
The NUR token is a utility token and is not presented as a financial product.
It is used for:
• transaction fees (gas) and standard network usage on the NOORCHAIN 2.1 L1
• submitting and validating PoSS-related actions and snapshots
• interacting with protocol-aligned ecosystem applications (e.g., Curators Hub and other non-financial dApps)
• governance participation under a non-financial posture
NOORCHAIN follows a Swiss Legal Light CH posture, which requires:
• no custody of user assets by NOORCHAIN governance bodies
• no guaranteed returns and no yield-like narratives
• no investment or speculative messaging as an official protocol posture
• full transparency in governance boundaries and public documentation
• strict separation between Foundation governance, Development operations, and curator roles
This Tokenomics document describes the protocol’s economic architecture in a public, formal, and regulator-friendly format.
In case of conflict, the Foundation Statutes and the NOORCHAIN legal architecture prevail.

2. Fixed Supply & Non-Inflation Principles

2.1 Total Supply (Immutable Cap)
The total supply of NUR is permanently capped at:
299,792,458 NUR
This quantity is a symbolic reference to the speed of light, reflecting the project’s commitment to transparency, universality, and physical invariants.

2.2 No Supply Expansion — No Discretionary Inflation
NOORCHAIN does not allow discretionary supply expansion.
• No governance process, upgrade, Foundation action, Development Entity action, or multi-sig execution can increase the total cap.
• Any distribution over time is strictly bounded by the genesis-defined allocations and the PoSS Mintable Reserve, under transparent and auditable rules.
• No discretionary expansion of the PoSS reserve is permitted.
This means NOORCHAIN is non-inflationary in the strict sense of “no cap expansion,” and distribution remains limited to the protocol-defined reserve and ruleset.

2.3 Utility Token Classification
NUR is strictly presented as a utility token and is not positioned as a payment token, security token, or investment instrument.
It is not designed for:
• yield generation
• savings or interest
• passive income mechanics
NUR does not grant equity, dividends, claims on assets, or any form of financial participation rights.

3. Genesis Allocation Model (Immutable Percentages)
The entire cap of 299,792,458 NUR is allocated at genesis according to a permanent, Swiss-aligned distribution framework referred to as 5 / 5 / 5 / 5 / 80.
This structure is fixed and cannot be modified after network launch.

3.1 Allocation Overview
Allocation Category | Percentage | Amount (NUR) | Purpose
Foundation | 5% | 14,989,622.9 | Governance and public stewardship
Development Entity (Sàrl) | 5% | 14,989,622.9 | Technical development and infrastructure
PoSS Stimulus Pool | 5% | 14,989,622.9 | Early ecosystem activation and curator onboarding support
Pre-sale Reserve (optional) | 5% | 14,989,622.9 | Regulated private fundraising only, if activated
PoSS Mintable Reserve | 80% | 239,833,966.4 | Long-term PoSS distribution bounded by protocol rules
These allocations are defined at genesis and enforced by protocol constraints.
They may not be pledged as collateral, used as loan security, or repurposed for financial engineering under the official protocol posture.

3.2 Allocation Purpose & Governance Rationale
Foundation (5%) — Non-Profit Stewardship
The Foundation is responsible for:
• governance discipline and compliance posture
• public documentation and transparency obligations
• institutional partnerships and curator network stewardship
• audits and long-term public accountability
Foundation resources must remain mission-aligned and must not be used for speculative or financial operations.
Development Entity (5%) — Operational Allocation
The Development Entity supports:
• protocol maintenance and long-term development
• infrastructure operations and reliability engineering
• ecosystem integrations and institutional deployments
This allocation does not grant authority to expand supply, alter structural economic rules, or override Legal Light constraints.
PoSS Stimulus Pool (5%) — Early Ecosystem Activation
This pool supports early adoption and enablement, such as:
• curator onboarding and tooling support
• institutional pilots and enablement programs
• ecosystem activation aligned with PoSS recognition workflows
It remains governed under strict controls and transparency rules.
Pre-sale Reserve (5%) — Optional & Regulated
If activated, this reserve can be used only under:
• Swiss-aligned compliance constraints
• mandatory vesting schedules
• transparent governance conditions
• multi-sig approvals and documented execution
It does not represent an ICO, a public token sale, or an investment product.
If no pre-sale occurs, the reserve remains managed under compliant procedures without altering the total cap or structural invariants.
PoSS Mintable Reserve (80%) — Long-Term Distribution
This reserve underpins long-term PoSS distribution over multiple eras.
Characteristics include:
• distribution only via PoSS rules and validated processes
• transparent and predictable pacing
• 8-year halving rhythm for long-term sustainability
• prohibition of discretionary distribution outside the PoSS ruleset
All PoSS rewards originate exclusively from this reserve, within the fixed cap.

3.3 Institutional Roles in the Economic Model
Foundation
Acts as the neutral, public-good governance entity.
Holds 5% allocation under multi-sig control and transparency rules.
Does not provide custodial services, payment services, investment services, or market-making activities.
Development Entity (Sàrl)
Executes technical development, infrastructure operations, and ecosystem integrations.
May generate revenue through services (e.g., SaaS, integrations) without protocol-level financial promises.
Has no authority to increase supply, modify the fixed cap, or alter immutable economic rules.
Multi-sig Committee (3/5)
Executes governance actions and safeguards governance-managed allocations.
Cannot modify fixed supply, allocation percentages, the PoSS structural distribution principle (70/30), the halving rhythm, or Legal Light compliance boundaries.
Curators
Validate PoSS-related actions according to published guidelines.
Receive the curator share of PoSS distributions as defined by structural protocol rules.
Hold no protocol-level treasury authority and do not control consensus security.
Community and Participants
Interact with the network in a self-custodial manner.
Submit contribution evidence for validation, use ecosystem applications, and participate in governance processes that remain non-financial in posture.

3.4 Immutable Governance Constraints
The following principles cannot be changed, including by governance, upgrades, or multi-sig execution:
• total supply cap (299,792,458 NUR)
• genesis allocation percentages (5 / 5 / 5 / 5 / 80)
• PoSS structural distribution principle (70/30 participant/curator)
• halving rhythm (8 years)
• prohibition of discretionary supply expansion
• prohibition of discretionary distribution outside protocol rules
• Legal Light CH compliance boundaries (non-custodial posture, no yield claims, no investment framing)
4. Allocation Controls, Locking, and Vesting (Public Rules)

4.1 General Control Principles
NOORCHAIN enforces economic discipline through immutable allocation percentages at genesis, segregation of institutional pools by purpose, multi-sig operational controls for governance-managed pools, and transparency obligations for major movements of institutional allocations.

4.2 Non-Custodial and No-Intermediation Constraint
NOORCHAIN governance bodies do not custody user assets and do not provide payment, investment, or brokerage services. Protocol rules and official operations must avoid any behavior that could be interpreted as financial intermediation.

4.3 Allocation Addressing and Segregation
Each allocation category is assigned to a dedicated on-chain address (or multi-sig address where applicable) to preserve traceability and prevent pool commingling. The segregation principle is mandatory for: Foundation allocation, Development allocation, PoSS Stimulus Pool, Pre-sale Reserve (if activated), and PoSS Mintable Reserve.

4.4 Locking and Release Discipline (Public Posture)
Where locking is applied, it exists for governance discipline and long-term integrity rather than financial engineering. Locking mechanisms are designed to prevent discretionary use, reduce concentration risk, and maintain institutional credibility. Locking does not create yield, does not create claims, and does not grant financial rights.

4.5 Vesting Rules (If Applicable)
Where vesting is used for institutional allocations, vesting is enforced by transparent schedules and documented governance decisions. Vesting is designed to ensure long-term operational continuity and to reduce sudden supply concentration risks. Vesting cannot modify total supply, cannot expand the cap, and cannot override immutable allocation percentages.

4.6 Prohibition of Collateralisation and Debt Engineering
Genesis allocations and institutional reserves may not be pledged as collateral, used as loan security, or structured into leveraged instruments under the official protocol posture. Any activity resembling lending, credit creation, or interest-bearing structures is outside NOORCHAIN’s compliance perimeter.

5. Proof of Signal Social (PoSS) — Economic Model

5.1 Scope and Positioning (PoSS ≠ Consensus)
PoSS (Proof of Signal Social) is NOORCHAIN’s application-layer recognition mechanism. It structures curator-validated contribution evidence and distributes protocol-defined recognition amounts under strict transparency rules. PoSS is not consensus, does not secure the chain, and does not affect the permissioned BFT security layer.

5.2 Immutable Reward Split (70/30)
Every validated PoSS event distributes recognition amounts as follows: 70% to the participant submitting the action and 30% to the curator validating the action. This structural split is hard-coded and cannot be changed by governance, upgrades, or parameter adjustments.

5.3 Reward Structure (Conceptual Model)
PoSS distributions are computed from protocol-defined parameters, including a BaseReward, an action-type weight, a halving era coefficient, and governance-limited daily caps. A simplified conceptual form is: raw_reward = BaseReward × Weight(action_type) ; halved_reward = raw_reward / (2^halving_era) ; distribution = 70% × halved_reward to participant and 30% × halved_reward to curator. This mechanism is transparent, rule-based, and capped.

5.4 Action Type Weights (Genesis Baseline Values)
Action-type weights express relative social impact and are operational parameters subject to governance within bounded limits. Any adjustment must remain consistent with the non-financial posture and must not modify structural invariants such as fixed supply cap, allocation percentages, the 70/30 split, or the halving rhythm.

5.5 Halving Every 8 Years
PoSS follows an 8-year mechanical halving rhythm. At each halving boundary, PoSS distribution amounts are divided by two in protocol terms, extending the reserve lifespan and reinforcing long-term sustainability. The halving schedule is independent of market price, demand, or external financial performance.

5.6 Daily Limits and Anti-Abuse Caps
To prevent farming and protect institutional legitimacy, PoSS enforces caps such as: maximum signals per participant per day, maximum validations per curator per day, maximum distributions per participant per day, and maximum distributions per curator per day. These parameters may be adjusted by governance within strict boundaries and cannot affect structural invariants.

5.7 Non-Financial Positioning
PoSS is designed to avoid financial or investment characteristics. It is protocol-defined recognition linked to verified actions, without deposits, lock-ups for yield, APR/APY, or interest. PoSS outputs must not be communicated as income, salary, or guaranteed return.

5.8 Transparency and Auditability of PoSS Distribution
All PoSS-related distributions and records are on-chain, traceable, and auditable. There are no hidden emissions, no discretionary distributions outside the PoSS ruleset, and no privileged access paths.
6. Long-Term Distribution Timeline (PoSS Reserve)

6.1 Distribution Eras (8-Year Halving Rhythm)
The PoSS Mintable Reserve (80% of total supply) is structured to support multi-decade distribution under a predictable halving rhythm.
The distribution model can be expressed in eras aligned with 8-year periods:
Era 1 (Years 0–8): 100% of baseline parameters
Era 2 (Years 9–16): 50% of baseline parameters
Era 3 (Years 17–24): 25% of baseline parameters
Era 4 (Years 25–32): 12.5% of baseline parameters
Era 5+ (Years 33+): continuing halving in the same pattern
This timeline is a technical pacing model. It is not a duration guarantee and must not be interpreted as a financial projection.

6.2 Cap Integrity and Reserve-Bounded Distribution
NOORCHAIN’s fixed cap remains the primary economic invariant.
All PoSS distributions are bounded by the PoSS Mintable Reserve defined at genesis and cannot exceed the overall supply cap.
There is no discretionary supply expansion, and no “open-ended” issuance mechanism outside the reserve-bounded ruleset.

6.3 Sustainability Under Variable Adoption
Actual reserve longevity depends on real PoSS activity and governance-limited daily caps.
The halving schedule reduces distribution intensity over time and provides a long-tail pattern suitable for institutional ecosystems that evolve slowly.

6.4 Independence from Market Dynamics
PoSS distribution is not market-driven.
It does not respond to token price, liquidity conditions, market demand, or speculative cycles.
The protocol posture explicitly avoids linking distribution narratives to price or financial performance.

6.5 Legal Light CH Alignment of Distribution Language
All official communications must treat PoSS outputs as recognition amounts linked to validated actions, not as income or yield.
Distribution pacing must be described as protocol-defined and auditable, without forward-looking return narratives.

7. Governance Powers and Economic Safety Boundaries

7.1 Immutable Economic Constraints
The following elements are permanently fixed and cannot be altered by governance, upgrades, multi-sig execution, or operational policy:
total supply cap (299,792,458 NUR)
allocation percentages (5 / 5 / 5 / 5 / 80)
PoSS structural split (70/30 participant/curator)
8-year halving rhythm
prohibition of discretionary cap expansion
prohibition of discretionary distribution outside protocol rules
Legal Light CH compliance boundaries (non-custodial posture, no yield claims, no investment framing)

7.2 Adjustable Parameters (Operational, Bounded)
Governance may adjust specific operational parameters within strict boundaries, such as:
PoSS daily caps (participant and curator limits)
action-type weights
curator onboarding procedures and eligibility criteria
dApp integration policies consistent with the non-financial posture
validator and network parameters related to the permissioned BFT operations
Any adjustments must be documented, auditable, and consistent with the immutable constraints.

7.3 Prohibited Governance Actions
Governance cannot:
increase the supply cap or create discretionary inflation
change allocation percentages or redirect reserve purposes
modify the 70/30 structural split
change the halving rhythm
introduce staking yield, APR/APY, or investment-like mechanisms
authorize custodial operations or financial intermediation under NOORCHAIN entities

7.4 Transparency and Documentation Obligations
All governance actions affecting economic parameters must be:
documented in a public record
traceable to a formal proposal or decision process
executed through the designated multi-sig control path
archived for institutional review and long-term auditability
8. Legal Light CH Economic Compliance Boundaries
8.1 Core Compliance Constraints
To maintain a Swiss Legal Light CH posture, NOORCHAIN must avoid any behavior or communication that could be interpreted as an investment product, a yield mechanism, or a financial service.
This perimeter applies to the Foundation, the Development Entity (Sàrl), the multi-sig committee, and all official communications.

8.2 No Yield, No Staking, No APR/APY Posture
NOORCHAIN does not promote staking, yield farming, or interest-bearing mechanisms.
PoSS distributions are protocol-defined recognition amounts tied to validated actions and must not be framed as income, salary, or return.

8.3 Non-Custodial Constraint
NOORCHAIN governance bodies do not custody user funds and do not operate wallets on behalf of users.
Users remain solely responsible for their keys and asset security at all times.

8.4 No Internal Fiat Conversion and No On/Off-Ramp Operation
NOORCHAIN does not operate fiat conversion, on-ramp, or off-ramp services.
Any conversion services, if used by participants, must be provided externally by regulated providers under their own compliance frameworks.

8.5 Transparency as a Compliance Requirement
Economic rules, immutable constraints, allocation boundaries, and governance procedures must remain publicly documented.
Transparency is treated as a structural compliance safeguard rather than an optional communication choice.

9. Allowed vs. Forbidden Economic Activities (Public Posture)
9.1 Allowed Activities (Within Compliance Perimeter)
The following activities are compatible with the utility-token posture and institutional adoption objectives:
orderbook-based exchange access operated by third parties (e.g., centralized exchanges)
external free-market trading not operated by NOORCHAIN entities
utility-driven demand through protocol-aligned applications
partnerships with NGOs, schools, and institutions for PoSS-based recognition programs
grants, innovation funding, and non-speculative sponsorships
service revenue generated by the Development Entity (Sàrl) through integrations and software services
external payment providers and PSPs operating independently of NOORCHAIN governance bodies

9.2 Forbidden Activities (Non-Negotiable Prohibitions)
To preserve legal clarity and mission integrity, the following activities are prohibited under the official protocol posture:
loans, interest, or credit mechanisms operated by NOORCHAIN entities
staking products, APR/APY narratives, or yield-bearing schemes
Foundation-operated liquidity pools or market-making
token sales marketed as investment opportunities
guaranteed token performance claims or forward-looking return statements
custody of user assets by Foundation or governance bodies
buybacks, coordinated price influence, or manipulation strategies
financial derivatives, leveraged products, or synthetic instruments under NOORCHAIN entities

10. Foundation vs. Development Entity — Separation of Powers
10.1 Structural Separation
NOORCHAIN relies on a strict separation between governance stewardship (Foundation) and operational delivery (Development Entity).
This separation reduces conflicts of interest and reinforces institutional trust.

10.2 Foundation (Non-Profit Stewardship)
The Foundation manages governance, transparency, documentation, partnerships, and compliance posture.
It does not conduct commercial financial operations, does not provide regulated services, and does not custody user assets.

10.3 Development Entity (Sàrl) (Operational Execution)
The Development Entity is responsible for engineering, infrastructure, and ecosystem integrations.
It may generate revenue via services and software delivery, without implying protocol-level financial promises or returns.

10.4 Multi-sig Committee (Execution Layer)
The multi-sig committee executes approved governance actions for governance-managed pools and upgrades.
It is an execution layer, not a financial operator, and cannot override immutable economic constraints.
11. Market Model and Exchange Principles
11.1 Market Access Posture (Non-Financial Positioning)
NOORCHAIN recognises that secondary-market access may exist, but the protocol does not rely on market dynamics as a growth mechanism.
Official communications must not frame market access as a promise of appreciation, liquidity, or return.
11.2 Orderbook-Based Exchange Access (Preferred Form)
Where exchange access exists, orderbook-based venues are the preferred model because they do not require protocol-operated liquidity pools.
Any listing is a third-party market arrangement and must remain operationally and legally separated from NOORCHAIN governance bodies.
11.3 External Liquidity (Not Operated by NOORCHAIN Entities)
If liquidity exists, it must originate from independent market actors and external venues.
Neither the Foundation nor the Development Entity may operate liquidity pools, provide market-making, or coordinate price support.
11.4 Prohibited Market Mechanisms
To preserve Legal Light compliance and mission integrity, NOORCHAIN entities must not engage in:
internal liquidity pools or protocol-backed AMM strategies
buybacks or price-support programs
yield framing, APR/APY messaging, or investment promotion
derivatives, leverage, or structured financial products under NOORCHAIN entities
11.5 Public Communication Discipline (Mandatory)
All public materials must adhere to the following discipline:
no performance claims
no “investment case” framing
no price targets or forward-looking market narratives
no language implying income, yield, or guaranteed outcomes
This discipline applies to Foundation communications, Development Entity communications when representing the protocol, and all official documentation.
12. Leadership Conduct and Economic Integrity
12.1 No Privileged Access and No Discretionary Controls
Leadership roles do not grant special access to governance-managed reserves and do not provide authority to alter supply or structural rules.
All actions affecting governance-managed pools must follow documented procedures and multi-sig execution.
12.2 Development Allocation Use (Operational Discipline)
The Development Entity allocation is intended to sustain engineering, operations, and long-term delivery.
It must not be used as a mechanism for market influence or speculative signaling.
12.3 Transfer Discipline and Transparency Expectations
Significant transfers from institutional pools should be documented to preserve institutional trust and reduce misinformation risk.
This is a governance transparency requirement, not a market commitment.
12.4 No Price Influence Policy
NOORCHAIN governance bodies and leadership must refrain from any conduct that could be interpreted as coordinated price influence.
This includes public statements designed to affect token price, coordinated trading activity, or implied commitments to support liquidity.
13. Economic Integrity and Sustainability Summary
13.1 Structural Properties
NOORCHAIN’s tokenomics are defined by a fixed supply cap, immutable allocation percentages, reserve-bounded PoSS distribution, and an 8-year halving rhythm.
These properties are designed to be stable, auditable, and compatible with institution-grade adoption.
13.2 Non-Financial Utility Posture
NUR is positioned as a utility token used for network usage (including gas), PoSS-related participation flows, and protocol-aligned applications.
The protocol posture explicitly excludes yield framing, staking incentives, and investment narratives.
13.3 Institutional Compatibility
The economic model is designed to support long-term partnerships with schools, NGOs, and public-interest organisations through transparent rules and a predictable compliance perimeter.
This compatibility is strengthened by strict separation of roles between the Foundation, the Development Entity, and curator actors.

14.2 Revision Policy
Updates to this document may occur only under:
clarifications in language and definitions
updates following governance-approved operational parameter adjustments
formatting or structural improvements
Core economic principles (supply cap, allocation percentages, PoSS structural split, halving rhythm, Legal Light constraints) cannot be changed.
15. Technical Scope and Architecture Compatibility Notes
15.1 Sovereign EVM Layer-1 (NOORCHAIN 2.1)
NOORCHAIN 2.1 is implemented as a sovereign EVM Layer-1 network.
It is not an Ethereum L2 and does not depend on Ethereum mainnet for security or settlement.
15.2 Consensus Security vs. PoSS Application Layer (Strict Separation)
Chain security is provided by a permissioned BFT consensus layer (deterministic finality, accountable operators).
PoSS (Proof of Signal Social) is an application-layer mechanism and does not participate in consensus or validator security.
15.3 Gas and Network Fees (Utility Function)
NUR is used as the native token for network fees (gas) on the NOORCHAIN 2.1 Layer-1.
This utility function is distinct from any investment framing and remains bounded by the Legal Light posture of the project.
15.4 EVM Compatibility (Tooling and Controlled Use Cases)
EVM compatibility is provided to enable standard tooling and controlled social-utility applications.
The protocol does not position itself as a DeFi platform and does not endorse financial smart-contract ecosystems under its official posture.
15.5 Non-Custodial Boundary (Operational Constraint)
NOORCHAIN governance bodies do not custody user assets and do not operate wallets on behalf of users.
User custody remains a strict boundary condition for institutional and regulatory alignment.
16. Public Implementation Status and Maturity Boundaries
16.1 Purpose of This Section
This section states what is publicly asserted about NOORCHAIN 2.1 maturity without overstating capability or implying guarantees.
It exists to reduce ambiguity for institutional readers and technical reviewers.
16.2 Mainnet-Like Engineering Status (Public Statement)
NOORCHAIN 2.1 has been engineered toward a “mainnet-like” operational standard: multi-node operation, deterministic finality posture, stable RPC surface for tooling, and controlled application-layer PoSS flows.
This statement describes operational direction and tested capabilities, not a promise of production readiness in all environments.
16.3 Scope of PoSS in Public Tokenomics
PoSS is treated as a reserve-bounded distribution and recognition mechanism.
Its public description in Tokenomics is economic and compliance-oriented, not a claim of exhaustive application coverage or institutional deployment guarantees.
16.4 What This Document Does Not Claim
This Tokenomics document does not claim: guaranteed market access, guaranteed liquidity, guaranteed duration of reserve distribution, guaranteed institutional adoption, or any form of return expectation.
It describes immutable constraints, allowed conduct boundaries, and protocol-aligned economic principles.
17. Glossary (Concise)
17.1 NUR
The native utility token of NOORCHAIN 2.1, used for network fees (gas) and protocol-aligned utility flows.
17.2 Fixed Supply Cap
An immutable maximum of 299,792,458 NUR that cannot be increased by governance, upgrades, or operational bodies.
17.3 Genesis Allocation (5 / 5 / 5 / 5 / 80)
A permanent allocation framework defining institutional pools and the PoSS Mintable Reserve as a bounded source for PoSS distributions.
17.4 PoSS (Proof of Signal Social)
An application-layer recognition mechanism based on curator-validated contribution evidence; it is not consensus and does not secure the chain.
17.5 Curator
An accountable actor (typically institutional) that validates contribution evidence under published guidelines.
17.6 Legal Light CH Posture
A compliance posture centered on non-custodial usage, no yield framing, no investment messaging, transparent rules, and strict role separation.
17.7 Permissioned BFT Consensus
A deterministic-finality consensus approach where validator participation is permissioned for operational accountability and controlled security governance.
18. Closing Legal Notice (Consistency Clause)
