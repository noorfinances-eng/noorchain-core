Implemented Vercel Web Analytics integration for Next.js as requested.

## Summary
Successfully installed and configured Vercel Web Analytics for the noorchain-core Next.js application using the App Router architecture.

## Changes Made

### Created/Modified Files:

1. **Modified: app/layout.tsx**
   - Added import statement: `import { Analytics } from "@vercel/analytics/next";`
   - Added `<Analytics />` component inside the `<body>` tag, placed after the Footer component
   - The component is now properly positioned in the root layout to track analytics across the application

2. **Modified: package.json**
   - Added dependency: `@vercel/analytics@^1.6.1`

## Implementation Details

The integration was implemented for an App Router project structure:
- **Project Type**: Next.js 14.2.3 with App Router (app/ directory structure)
- **Package Manager**: npm
- **Framework**: React 18.2.0

## Installation Steps Completed

1. ✅ Installed @vercel/analytics package using `npm install @vercel/analytics`
2. ✅ Imported Analytics component from '@vercel/analytics/next' in root layout
3. ✅ Added `<Analytics />` component to app/layout.tsx inside the body tag
4. ✅ Verified build completes successfully with `npm run build`
5. ✅ Confirmed no TypeScript or build errors introduced

## Build Verification

The Next.js build completed successfully:
- All 13 pages generated correctly
- No TypeScript errors
- Build output shows all routes rendering properly (both static and dynamic)

## Notes

- The Analytics component was placed inside the body tag after all other main layout components (NavBar, main content, Footer) to ensure proper tracking initialization
- The auto-generated files (next-env.d.ts, tsconfig.json) were updated by Next.js during the build process but were not staged as they are generated build artifacts
- package-lock.json was generated but not staged as it's in the .gitignore file
- The implementation follows the Next.js 14.2.3 standard for Vercel Web Analytics integration
