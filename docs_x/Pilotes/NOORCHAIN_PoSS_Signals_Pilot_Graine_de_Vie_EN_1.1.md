1. Purpose of This Document

This document defines the Proof of Signal Social (PoSS) signals used within the framework of the educational pilot with Graine de Vie school.

Its objectives are to:

test educational, social, and civic signals,

validate their clarity, traceability, and educational relevance,

prepare a future standardisation for other schools.

All signals described in this document are:

non-financial,

symbolic,

experimental,

strictly limited to an educational context.

2. General Principles of Educational PoSS Signals

All pilot signals comply with the following principles:

No signal represents monetary value.

No signal constitutes a financial reward.

No signal involves tradable tokens.

No signal is equivalent to paid work.

Participation is entirely voluntary.

Signals are tied to real, positive actions.

3. PoSS Signal Categories (Pilot)

The pilot relies on four signal categories, adapted to the school environment.

3.1 Educational Participation Signals

Purpose: encourage engagement and active participation.

Examples of actions:

participation in an educational workshop,

involvement in a collective project,

active presence during a learning activity,

participation in a supervised discussion.

Characteristics:

simple signal,

low weighting,

controlled frequency,

human validation.

3.2 Social Contribution Signals

Purpose: recognise actions that benefit the school community.

Examples of actions:

helping another student,

participation in a collective initiative (garden, recycling, mutual aid),

contribution to an internal solidarity project,

mediation or support actions.

Characteristics:

intermediate signal,

qualitative validation required,

recognised as civic contribution.

3.3 Creation & Expression Signals

Purpose: encourage creativity and personal expression.

Examples of actions:

artistic creation linked to an educational theme,

production of educational content (text, drawing, presentation),

contribution to a collective creative project,

learning restitution or explanation.

Characteristics:

variable weighting,

validated based on pedagogical criteria,

no performance-based judgement.

3.4 Ecological & Ethical Signals

Purpose: promote responsible and sustainable behaviours.

Examples of actions:

participation in ecological activities,

environmental awareness initiatives,

engagement in sustainable practices,

promotion of the school’s ethical values.

Characteristics:

high symbolic value,

validation by an educational referent,

aligned with Graine de Vie’s mission.

4. Signal Validation
4.1 Validation Method

During the pilot:

validation is manual or semi-manual,

performed by designated educational referents,

no blind automation.

4.2 Role of Validators

Validators:

confirm the reality of the action,

assess alignment with educational values,

hold no financial or technical authority.

5. Limits and Safeguards

Signals are capped per period.

No excessive accumulation.

No competitive ranking.

No public individual display.

No comparison between students.

The objective is learning, not performance.

6. Data Protection & Privacy

No student names are recorded on-chain.

No personal identifiers are stored.

Signals may be anonymised or aggregated.

Educational data remains internal to the school.

7. Use of Signals During the Pilot

Signals are used exclusively to:

observe behaviours,

test understanding of the PoSS model,

document the experience,

improve future educational frameworks.

They are not used to:

assign grades,

create financial rewards,

generate economic hierarchies.

8. Post-Pilot Evolution

After the pilot, signals may:

be adjusted,

merged,

removed,

or extended to other pilot schools.

No automatic continuation is guaranteed.

9. Conclusion

This educational PoSS signal framework enables:

responsible experimentation,

innovative pedagogy,

concrete understanding of social blockchain concepts,

while remaining fully compliant with Swiss Legal Light CH principles.
