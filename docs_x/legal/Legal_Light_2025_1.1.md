NOORCHAIN — Legal Light Framework (Switzerland)
Version 1.1
Last Updated: 2025-XX-XX
1. Purpose of this Framework

This document defines the regulatory position of the NOORCHAIN protocol under the Swiss Legal Light CH model.
It provides clarity for:

the NOORCHAIN Foundation

contributors and developers

curators and ecosystem partners

users interacting with the protocol

It is a transparency and compliance framework, not legal advice.

2. Legal Classification

NOORCHAIN is classified as an:

Open, non-custodial, utility-based blockchain protocol,

operated by a Swiss non-profit association,
with a fixed-supply token (NUR) and a social-impact validation model (PoSS).

It is not considered:

a bank or financial intermediary

an investment product or security

a custodial service

a yield-generating platform

a regulated payment service provider

This positioning ensures compatibility with Swiss non-profit and financial guidelines.

3. Core Legal Principles
3.1 Non-Custodial Architecture

The Foundation, the multi-sig committee, and contributors must never:

hold or manage user assets

operate wallets for third parties

access or store private keys

All users act autonomously and remain fully responsible for their wallets.

3.2 No Promised Returns

NOORCHAIN does not:

guarantee financial returns

promote price appreciation

offer interest-bearing or yield-based services

advertise NUR as a financial product

PoSS rewards are protocol-defined and based only on validated social actions.

3.3 No Investment Offering

The Foundation does not sell tokens as investments, securities, or financial instruments.

Any optional pre-sale allocation must include:

vesting

clear documentation

non-speculative messaging

separation between the Foundation and Noor Dev Sàrl

3.4 Fixed Supply — No Inflation

Total supply is immutable:

299,792,458 NUR

There is:

no inflation

no discretionary minting

no yield-based issuance

PoSS rewards rely exclusively on the predefined 80% PoSS reserve.

3.5 Non-Profit Orientation

All Foundation activities must follow Swiss non-profit principles:

transparency

independence

ethical governance

public-good alignment

open documentation

The Foundation cannot operate for commercial profit.

4. Token Classification (Swiss Regulatory View)

Based on FINMA guidelines, NUR is classified as a:

Utility Token (Non-Financial)

Its primary functions:

interaction with the protocol

validation of PoSS actions

powering dApps (Pay, Curators Hub, Studio)

rewarding positive social contributions

NUR is not:

a payment token with fiat gateways

a stablecoin

an investment or revenue-generating product

5. Foundation Restrictions (Mandatory)

The Foundation must not:

custody user assets

offer exchange or conversion services

conduct financial intermediation

operate a PSP

accept investor funds directly

manipulate markets

provide guaranteed returns

modify NUR total supply

The Foundation may:

coordinate governance

maintain infrastructure

fund audits and research

support NGOs, schools, and social partners

maintain legal and transparency frameworks

6. Curator Responsibilities (Legal Boundaries)

Curators (NGOs, schools, associations):

validate PoSS actions ethically

must avoid abuse or fraudulent claims

follow privacy and data-protection rules

cannot convert PoSS rewards inside the Foundation

act independently, not as employees

They contribute to social validation but hold no custodial or financial authority.

7. PoSS Legal Classification

PoSS (Proof of Signal Social) is legally defined as:

A social-mechanism reward system,

not a staking mechanism, yield product, or financial incentive program.

Characteristics:

rewards based on real social actions

no deposit required

no lock-up

no APR, APY, or performance incentives

fully capped and emission-controlled

transparent and verifiable

PoSS rewards are not remuneration, not salary, and not financial yield.

8. Fiat Conversion (External Only)

NOORCHAIN does not:

convert NUR ↔ fiat

process payments in CHF/EUR

operate KYC/AML services

act as a payment processor

If users seek conversion, they must use external regulated PSP partners (e.g., Mt Pelerin, NOWPayments).

The Foundation does not:

oversee PSP operations

endorse conversion services

participate in regulatory processes of PSPs

This ensures separation and compliance with Swiss Legal Light standards.

9. Compliance Boundaries (Non-Negotiable Rules)

These boundaries are immutable for Legal Light compatibility:

No custody of user funds

No guaranteed returns

No investment offering

No internal PSP or exchange

No manipulation of token markets

No modification of fixed supply

No financial promotion

No uncontrolled minting or inflation

Any breach requires:

immediate multi-sig action

public disclosure

Foundation Board review

10. Official Disclaimers

These disclaimers must appear on:

the website

whitepapers

GitHub documentation

governance & legal documents

No Investment Advice

NOORCHAIN does not provide investment or financial recommendations.

No Guaranteed Returns

The NUR token does not guarantee any financial return or yield.

Non-Custodial Use

Users are fully responsible for managing their wallets and private keys.

Open-Source Risk

Blockchain software may contain risks; users must act responsibly.

Regulatory Context

NOORCHAIN follows Swiss Legal Light principles.
Regulations may evolve over time.
