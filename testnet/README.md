# NOORCHAIN Testnet — Draft

This directory contains configuration and helper files for the NOORCHAIN
testnet environment.

> Status: draft — will be updated when the Cosmos SDK app is fully wired.

Planned content:

- `genesis.json` — testnet genesis file
- `peers.txt` — list of seed / persistent peers
- `scripts/` — shell scripts to create and start testnet nodes

For now, only minimal placeholder files are present.
