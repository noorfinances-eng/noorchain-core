# 1. Purpose of the Final Cross-Check

This document ensures that **all outputs** of Phase 5  
(A2 → B1 → B2 → C1 → C2 → C3 → D1 → D2 → D3 → E)  
are:

- consistent  
- legally aligned  
- governance-aligned  
- compatible with Swiss Legal Light CH  
- structurally coherent  
- ready for genesis integration  
- ready for Phase 6 and Phase 7  

This cross-check must be completed **before** the Genesis Pack and  
before preparing the mainnet files.

# 2. Legal Consistency Check

### Verified:
- Foundation Statutes v1.1 are compliant with Swiss CC Art. 60–79  
- Foundation = non-profit, independent, transparent  
- Sàrl = operational and separate (legal firewall)  
- Multi-sig = on-chain executor, not a custodian  
- PoSS = non-financial reward system  
- NUR = utility token (not security, not payment token with fiat gateway)  
- Fixed supply = 299,792,458 NUR  
- No promised returns  
- No custody  
- No investment language  

### No contradictions detected.

# 3. Governance Consistency Check

### Verified:
- Governance Charter (C2) aligns with:
  - Foundation Statutes  
  - Multi-sig Charter  
  - Legal Light  
  - Compliance Framework  

- Governance bodies:
  - Foundation Board  
  - Multi-sig Committee  
  - Curators  
  - Technical Contributors  
  are consistent across all documents.

### Quorum Levels:
- Foundation: majorities and unanimity rules correct  
- Multi-sig: 3/5 threshold correctly documented  
- Curators: advisory only  

### No governance conflict detected.

---

# 4. Tokenomics Consistency Check

### Allocation 5 / 5 / 5 / 5 / 80:
- Foundation: 5%  
- Dev Sàrl: 5%  
- PoSS Stimulus: 5%  
- Pre-sale optional: 5%  
- PoSS Reserve: 80%  

All documents (C3 + E + Legal Light) use the same model.

**No inconsistency.**

# 5. PoSS Model Consistency Check

### Structural elements:
- 70% participant / 30% curator (immutable)  
- Halving every 8 years (immutable)  
- No inflation (immutable)  
- No discretionary minting  
- Daily limits  
- Weight parameters  
- Governance-adjustable (except structural rules)  

### Legal classification:
- Non-financial  
- Social reward  
- Ethical model  
- No lock-up  
- No APR  

Everything matches D1, D3, C1, C2, C3.

# 6. Genesis Governance (C3) Consistency Check

Genesis includes:
- correct allocation percentages  
- immutability rules  
- initial PoSS parameters  
- prohibition of changing supply  
- prohibition of altering allocations  
- Multi-sig powers

They will be updated in Phase 7.
noor1foundationxxxxxxxxxxxx
noor1devsarlxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

noor1possreservexxxxxxxxxxx

All documents were designed to be updated once the 5 real bech32 addresses are generated.
