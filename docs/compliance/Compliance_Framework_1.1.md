# 1. Purpose of the Compliance Framework

This document defines the **complete compliance framework** for the  
NOORCHAIN ecosystem under the Swiss Legal Light CH classification.

It consolidates:
- legal principles,  
- operational limitations,  
- governance duties,  
- communication rules,  
- disclaimers,  
- PoSS compliance,  
- risk management,  
- and transparency requirements.

It applies to:
- NOORCHAIN Foundation  
- Multi-sig Committee  
- Noor Dev Sàrl (functional allocation)  
- Curators  
- Technical contributors  
- Partners (NGO, education, social actors)

This document will be transformed into an **official PDF** during Phase 6.

# 2. Compliance Classification (Legal Light CH)

NOORCHAIN operates as:

### **A non-profit, non-custodial, non-investment blockchain project.**

The Foundation:
- does not custody user assets  
- does not offer financial products  
- does not guarantee returns  
- does not run payment services  
- does not provide exchange or conversion  

NOORCHAIN is classified as a **Utility Token protocol with social impact**,  
not a financial intermediary under Swiss law.

---

# 3. Compliance Principles (Permanent)

The following principles are **immutable**:

### 3.1 No Custody  
The Foundation and multi-sig must never hold user funds or private keys.

### 3.2 No Promised Returns  
NUR does not promise yield, interest, dividends, or appreciation.

### 3.3 No Investment Offering  
NUR is not sold as a financial product.

### 3.4 Fixed Supply & No Inflation  
Supply is capped at 299,792,458 NUR.

### 3.5 Transparency  
All governance actions and use of funds must be publicly documented.

### 3.6 Open-Source & Ethical Mission  
All development must follow ethical and open-source standards.

### 3.7 Non-Profit Alignment  
Foundation resources must be used for public good purposes.

---

# 4. Token Compliance

NUR is classified as a **Utility Token** because it:

- enables validation of PoSS actions  
- powers dApps (Pay, Curators Hub, Studio)  
- rewards positive contributions  

NUR is **not**:
- a payment token with regulated fiat gateways  
- a security token  
- a stablecoin  
- an investment vehicle  

No token is issued in exchange for capital investment.

---

# 5. PoSS Compliance (Proof of Signal Social)

PoSS is designed to be:

- **non-financial**,  
- **ethical**,  
- **socially beneficial**,  
- **transparent**,  
- **non-extractive**,  
- **fully capped and controlled.**

### Classification:
**Social reward system**, not a yield product.

### Restrictions:
- no deposits required  
- no lock-up  
- no APR  
- no financial promise  
- reward = action × weight  
- hard-coded halving & caps  

All PoSS rewards are funded from the **80% PoSS Reserve**, not from inflation.

---

# 6. Operational Restrictions

The Foundation may not:
- manage wallets  
- hold user NUR  
- operate liquidity pools  
- manipulate the market  
- run exchange or PSP  
- guarantee prices  
- offer staking-as-a-service  
- accept investor funds intentionally (handled later via Sàrl)  

These restrictions protect the Foundation and ensure strict Legal Light CH compatibility.

### 7.1 Technical Risks
- bugs  
- exploits

Mitigation:
