NOORCHAIN — Genesis Allocation

Version 1.1 — Official Document
Language: EN
Last Updated: 2025-XX-XX

1. Purpose of This Document

This document defines the official economic allocation of the NOORCHAIN 1.0 genesis.
It provides clear, immutable rules describing how the total supply is divided, why this structure exists, and how each wallet must be used during the lifetime of the blockchain.

This is part of the Genesis Pack 1.1 and is binding for the project's governance, legal framework, and future development.

2. Total Supply

Total Supply: 299,792,458 NUR
Decimals: 18
Inflation: 0% — permanently
Future minting: forbidden
Supply modification via governance: forbidden

The supply is fixed from genesis and represents the maximum number of NUR that will ever exist.

3. Economic Allocation (5 / 5 / 5 / 5 / 80 Model)

The NOORCHAIN genesis uses a Swiss-inspired, transparent allocation model validated in Phase 5.

The distribution is:

5% — NOOR Foundation
Public-interest entity responsible for governance, transparency, communication, and ecosystem support.

5% — Noor Dev Sàrl (Development Entity)
Operational entity responsible for long-term development.
Note: The 5% liquid is included in genesis. The additional 10% vesting is handled outside genesis, under corporate governance rules.

5% — PoSS Stimulus Pool
A non-profit reserve used to support early adoption, curators onboarding, NGOs, and community participation.

5% — Optional Pre-sale Reserve
Dedicated strictly to regulated private or crowdfunding rounds under Swiss Legal Light.
Vesting is mandatory.
No tokens can be sold without legal compliance.

80% — PoSS Mintable Reserve
The long-term reward pool used by the Proof of Signal Social mechanism.
Distributed over decades through halving cycles.
Cannot be moved or reallocated outside PoSS.

This allocation ensures fairness, transparency, long-term sustainability, and Legal Light CH compatibility.

4. Allocation Table
Category	Percentage	Amount (NUR)	Purpose
Foundation	5%	14,989,622.9	Governance, public operations
Dev Sàrl	5%	14,989,622.9	Development and infrastructure
PoSS Stimulus	5%	14,989,622.9	Early adoption incentives
Pre-sale (optional)	5%	14,989,622.9	Regulated private fundraising
PoSS Reserve	80%	239,833,966.4	Social mining rewards (PoSS)

All numbers are rounded to decimals but enforced exactly in genesis.

5. Purpose of Each Allocation
5.1 NOOR Foundation (5%)

The Foundation acts as the neutral, non-profit governance body.
Its allocation is used for:

small operational costs

communication

community management

grants and partnerships

transparency obligations

The Foundation cannot distribute profits.

5.2 Noor Dev Sàrl (5% liquid in genesis)

This entity is the operational backbone of NOORCHAIN.

Its responsibilities include:

development

infrastructure

maintenance

audits

partnerships

The Sàrl is allowed to generate revenue but must respect Swiss legal obligations.

5.3 PoSS Stimulus Pool (5%)

This allocation supports:

onboarding curators

first validated social actions

NGOs and schools entering the ecosystem

pilot programs

It is used transparently and cannot be repurposed.

5.4 Pre-sale Reserve (5%, optional)

Used only if:

there is a private round

there is a crowdfunding round

Swiss legal conditions are fully respected

Mandatory rules:

vesting

multi-sig control

no speculative communication

transparency

If no sale happens, this reserve may remain untouched or be burned through governance rules.

5.5 PoSS Mintable Reserve (80%)

This is the long-term fuel of NOORCHAIN.

Distributed exclusively via PoSS:

halving every 8 years

structural 70/30 split

no manual transfers

no reallocation

no discretionary use

This pool sustains the chain for decades without inflation.

6. Legal and Governance Constraints

The allocation is governed by the following immutable rules:

Percentages cannot be modified

Supply cannot be changed

PoSS Reserve cannot be reassigned

No inflation allowed

Multi-sig control required for Foundation and Sàrl

Pre-sale must follow Swiss Legal Light requirements

These constraints ensure NOORCHAIN remains compliant and credible internationally.

7. Alignment With Swiss Ethical Blockchain Principles

This allocation model:

avoids concentration

avoids inflation

avoids hidden team allocations

guarantees transparency

ensures economic sustainability

matches Swiss norms for ethical digital assets

It is comparable in spirit to Swiss projects such as Nym, Alephium, Concordium, and Tezos (structure, not size).

8. Future Governance

Only non-structural parameters (for example, PoSS weights) may be adjusted through governance.

The following are immutable:

supply

allocation percentages

PoSS reward split

halving cycle

non-inflation rule

9. Versioning

Genesis Allocation — Version 1.1
Any update requires governance and legal review.
Structural elements cannot be modified.
