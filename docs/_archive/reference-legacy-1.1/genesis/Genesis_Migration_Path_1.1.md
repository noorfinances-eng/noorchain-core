NOORCHAIN — Genesis Migration Path

Version 1.1
Last Updated: 2025-XX-XX

1. Purpose of This Document

The Genesis Migration Path defines how NOORCHAIN transitions from:

the genesis block,

to the stable mainnet state,

to the PoSS-enabled network,

to the expandable governance-driven ecosystem.

It guarantees a safe, predictable, legally compliant evolution after mainnet launch.

This document is part of the Genesis Pack.

2. Migration Philosophy

NOORCHAIN follows a conservative migration philosophy:

Genesis first, stability first

PoSS activation only after confirmation

No immediate validator expansion

No automatic resource allocation

No treasury-like mechanisms

Governance-enabled, not governance-dependent

The migration path is intentionally gradual to maintain Legal Light CH compliance and protect users.

3. Phase 0 — Genesis (T0)

The network starts with:

PoSS disabled

Empty EVM state

No contracts pre-deployed

Minimal validator set

Fixed initial allocations

Governance enabled but restricted

No token minting occurs at Genesis.

4. Phase 1 — Stability Period (T0 → T0 + 3 months)

During this period, the following restrictions are enforced:

PoSS remains disabled

No module upgrades

No new governance powers

No new validators added (unless required)

No token distribution beyond genesis allocations

Monitoring tools are activated:

block explorers

indexers

governance dashboards

supply audit system

Objective: ensure chain stability before feature activation.

5. Phase 2 — PoSS Activation (Governance-Gated)

PoSS is activated only after:

Full stability report

Multi-sig Committee approval (3/5)

Foundation Board validation

Public announcement

Updated documentation

At activation:

PoSSEnabled is set to true

Minting begins from the 80% PoSS Reserve

Daily caps and weights enforced

PoSS activation must not violate Legal Light CH.

6. Phase 3 — Curator System Expansion

After PoSS activation:

Curators Bronze/Silver/Gold can be added

Validation capacity increases gradually

Reward distribution becomes network-wide

Advisory voting can be introduced

This phase introduces decentralization without compromising compliance.

7. Phase 4 — EVM Ecosystem Growth

Once PoSS is active and stable:

Smart contracts can be deployed

dApps may be launched (Hub, Pay, Studio)

Partners may onboard

Gas market becomes active

Each deployment must be reviewed by governance.

8. Phase 5 — Validator Set Expansion

Validator expansion may occur only when:

stake distribution is safe

governance approves

network performance is validated

Maximum validator count remains capped at genesis values unless modified by governance.

9. Phase 6 — Secondary Governance Activation

Governance gradually unlocks:

parameter changes

module upgrades

advisory roles

curator participation

Core restrictions remain immutable.

10. Phase 7 — Full Operational Mainnet

Network achieves full operational state when:

PoSS stable for 6 months

governance lifecycle proven

dApps operational

economic model validated

no security deviations detected

This is considered the complete migration from genesis to mature chain.

11. Non-Negotiable Invariants Throughout Migration

The following never change:

supply cap

PoSS 70/30 split

PoSS halving every 8 years

allocation percentages

Legal Light CH constraints

no custody of user funds

If any migration proposal violates these rules, it is automatically void.
