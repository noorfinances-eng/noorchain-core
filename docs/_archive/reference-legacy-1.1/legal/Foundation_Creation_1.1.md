## 1. Purpose of this Document

This document defines the **formal legal creation steps** of the  
**NOORCHAIN Foundation**, a non-profit association established in Switzerland.

These steps are required to legally constitute the Foundation, enable banking operations, and provide the organisational backbone for public governance and transparency.

---

## 2. Legal Basis

The Foundation is created under:

- Articles **60–79** of the Swiss Civil Code (ZGB / CC),  
- governing “Associations” (*Vereine / Associations*),  
- which allow full legal personality when statutes are adopted.

No inscription in the Commercial Register is mandatory unless:

- the Foundation conducts commercial activities,  
- or has a turnover requiring professional accounting.

At this stage, NOORCHAIN Foundation does **not** fall under these requirements.
