NOORCHAIN — Legal Architecture
Version 1.1
Last Updated: 2025-XX-XX
1. Purpose of this Document

The purpose of this Legal Architecture is to provide a clear, stable, and compliant legal structure for the NOORCHAIN blockchain ecosystem.
It defines:

the institutional roles

the separation of powers

risk boundaries

governance responsibilities

compliance requirements

the interaction between on-chain and off-chain entities

It ensures that NOORCHAIN remains aligned with its mission while maintaining regulatory safety, transparency, and long-term sustainability.

2. Legal Context (Switzerland – Legal Light Framework)

NOORCHAIN operates under a structure consistent with Swiss association law (CC 60–79) and the Legal Light CH model, characterized by:

Non-profit orientation

Non-custodial architecture

No investment offering

No promised yield

Open transparency standards

User self-custody

This framework ensures that NOORCHAIN remains outside the categories of:

financial intermediaries,

PSP entities,

custodial service providers,

investment products.

3. Institutional Architecture Overview

NOORCHAIN’s legal architecture is composed of four main entities:

NOORCHAIN Foundation

Multi-sig Committee (on-chain executive)

Curators (NGOs, schools, social actors)

Noor Dev Sàrl (technical development unit)

Each entity has strictly defined boundaries preventing conflicts of interest and ensuring Legal Light compliance.

4. NOORCHAIN Foundation (Non-Profit Association)

The Foundation is the legal anchor of the ecosystem.
Its responsibilities include:

safeguarding the mission and vision

maintaining compliance with Legal Light CH

managing the Foundation’s 5% allocation (non-custodially)

publishing reports and transparency documentation

supervising Curators

representing NOORCHAIN in off-chain legal contexts

coordinating governance processes

The Foundation does not:

hold user assets

operate wallets for third parties

run exchange or conversion systems

provide financial products

Its role is governance, supervision, and stewardship — not financial operations.

5. Multi-sig Committee (3/5)

The Multi-sig Committee is the on-chain executive arm of the Foundation.

Responsibilities:

Execute governance decisions

Manage the on-chain Foundation address

Apply PoSS parameter changes

Approve technical upgrades

Handle emergency operations (pause/disable modules)

Ensure compliance with Legal Light boundaries

Restrictions:

May not custody user assets

May not alter fixed supply

May not bypass governance

May not operate commercially

The committee must maintain transparency through periodic public reports.

6. Curators (Social Validators)

Curators include NGOs, schools, community organisations and verified social actors.

Roles:

Validate PoSS actions

Apply integrity and ethical standards

Support local communities and social initiatives

Contribute advisory opinions in governance consultations

Restrictions:

No governance authority

No custody or financial role

Must avoid abuse, manipulation, or reward farming

They receive 30% of PoSS reward allocation per validated action (non-financial, protocol-defined).

7. Noor Dev Sàrl (Technical Development Unit)

This entity represents the functional 5% supply allocation for development.

Responsibilities:

Maintain core codebase

Develop protocol upgrades

Support ecosystem applications (Pay, Curators Hub, Studio)

Provide technical documentation

Restrictions:

No governance authority

No custody of user funds

No financial intermediation

No discretionary supply control

The Sàrl operates independently and transparently, ensuring a clean separation between non-profit governance and technical development.

8. Separation of Powers (Legal and Operational)

NOORCHAIN enforces strict, permanent separation:

Entity	Power	Limitations
Foundation	Governance, Compliance, Mission	No custody, no financial operations
Multi-sig	On-chain execution	Cannot override fixed rules
Curators	Validate PoSS actions	Advisory only, no governance
Noor Dev Sàrl	Technical development	No governance, no custody

This model prevents concentration of authority and protects Legal Light compliance.

9. On-Chain Governance Architecture

On-chain governance includes:

Parameter updates (PoSS, limits, module settings)

Technical upgrades

Community proposals

Governance cannot modify:

total supply

PoSS structural split (70/30)

genesis allocations (5/5/5/5/80)

Legal Light restrictions

Any governance action requires:

Proposal

Documentation

Review

Multi-sig approval

Public communication

This process ensures transparency and accountability.

10. Risk Boundaries and Compliance

The following legal and operational risks are identified and controlled:

10.1 Technical Risks

Bugs, vulnerabilities, exploits, chain instability.
Mitigation: audits, code reviews, emergency procedures.

10.2 Legal Risks

Misclassification, custodial risk, speculative communication.
Mitigation: strict boundaries, compliant messaging, public reports.

10.3 User Risks

Loss of keys, phishing, misuse of third-party tools.
Mitigation: education and non-custodial warnings.

10.4 Governance Risks

Centralization, misuse of authority.
Mitigation: multi-sig rule, transparency, periodic reports.

11. Interaction with External Entities

NOORCHAIN does not:

run financial services

convert NUR ↔ fiat

offer KYC/AML processing

endorse particular PSPs

External PSP partners operate independently.

Partnerships (NGOs, schools, etc.) must align with:

ethical use

transparency

no financial misuse

independent responsibility
