# 1. Purpose of this Document

This Legal Light Framework defines the **regulatory position** of the  
NOORCHAIN project under the **Swiss Legal Light model**.  
It provides clarity, transparency, and legal safety for:

- the NOORCHAIN Foundation,  
- the founder and contributors,  
- curators and partners,  
- users of the network.

This document does **not** constitute legal advice, but is a compliance-aligned  
framework based on FINMA guidelines and Swiss non-profit principles.

---

# 2. Legal Classification (High-Level Summary)

NOORCHAIN is classified as a:

### **Non-custodial, utility-driven, public blockchain**,  
operated under a **Swiss non-profit association (Foundation)**,  
with a **fixed token supply** and a **social consensus model (PoSS)**  
designed for ethical and educational purposes.

It is **not** a:
- bank,  
- financial intermediary,  
- investment product,  
- custodial service,  
- yield-generating platform.  

This classification ensures **Legal Light CH compatibility**.

---

# 3. Core Legal Principles

### 3.1 No Custody
The Foundation and multi-sig must **never**:
- hold user funds,  
- manage balances,  
- operate wallets for third parties,  
- take control of private keys.

Users remain **100% sovereign** over their wallets.

---

### 3.2 No Promised Returns
NOORCHAIN does **not**:
- guarantee returns,  
- offer interest,  
- promote token price appreciation,  
- provide staking rewards as a financial product.

PoSS rewards are **protocol-defined** and **non-financial**,  
based on validated social actions.

---

### 3.3 No Investment Offering
The Foundation does **not** sell NUR tokens as:
- investments,  
- securities,  
- shares,  
- financial instruments.

Any token allocation (e.g., pre-sale) must include:
- vesting,  
- documentation,  
- and non-speculative messaging.

---

### 3.4 Fixed Supply & No Inflation
Total supply is immutable:
**299,792,458 NUR**.

There is no:
- inflation,  
- discretionary minting,  
- yield-based issuance.

PoSS rewards use a **pre-existing reserve** (80% of supply).

---

### 3.5 Non-Profit Orientation
All Foundation activities must follow:
- Swiss non-profit governance,  
- public good alignment,  
- transparency,  
- independence,
- ethical use cases.

---

# 4. Token Classification (Swiss Analysis)

Based on FINMA categories, NUR is:

### **Utility Token (Non-Financial)**  
because it is used to:
- validate PoSS actions,  
- interact with apps (Pay, Curators Hub, Studio),  
- reward ethical behavior,  
- support NGOs and schools.

It is **not**:
- a payment token with fiat gateways (no PSP internal),  
- a security token,  
- a stablecoin,  
- an investment vehicle.

---

1. Custody assets  
2. Operate a PSP  
3. Provide exchange services  
4. Conduct financial intermediation  
5. Guarantee returns

7. Use NUR for speculation  
8. Manipulate markets  

The Foundation MAY:
- fund education, social actions, and open-source work  
- maintain infrastructure  
- run governance and transparency  
- coordinate curators

---

# 6. Curator Responsibilities (Legal Constraints)

Curators (NGOs, schools, associations):
- cannot convert PoSS rewards into fiat within the Foundation  
- must validate actions responsibly  
- must avoid abuse  
- must publish transparency reports (if requested)  
- must comply with GDPR / Swiss privacy rules  

They remain **independent actors**, not employees of the Foundation.

---

# 7. PoSS Legal Classification

PoSS is classified as:

### **A social-mechanism reward system**,  
not as a yield or staking mechanism.

Characteristics:
- Reward based on **real actions**, not deposits  
- No financial promise  
- No lock-up  
- Weight-based reward for positive behavior  
- Transparent and capped  

It **does not** fall under regulated yield products.

---

# 8. No Fiat Conversion Inside NOORCHAIN

NOORCHAIN does not:
- convert NUR ↔ CHF/EUR/GBP  
- process payments in fiat  
- operate bank-like services  

If users want conversion:
- they must use **external PSP partners** (e.g., Mt Pelerin, NOWPayments)

- Foundation remains fully compliant  

---
