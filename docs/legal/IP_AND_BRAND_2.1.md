NOORCHAIN 2.1 — IP and Brand Policy

Document ID: IP_AND_BRAND_2.1
Version: v1.0
Date: January 2026
Status: Active
Scope: Defines intellectual property (IP) and brand usage policy for NOORCHAIN 2.1 documentation, software artifacts, names, and visual identity. This policy is operational and governance-aligned; it is not a marketing document.

Purpose

This document defines how NOORCHAIN 2.1 intellectual property and brand elements may be used, referenced, and distributed.

It is designed to:

preserve consistency and integrity of the NOORCHAIN identity

prevent misleading representations of the project or its status

define approved usage rules for name, marks, and artifacts

support controlled deployments and audit-ready documentation

maintain Legal-Light posture (no financial promises, no custody claims)

Scope

2.1 In Scope

project name usage (“NOORCHAIN”, “NOORCHAIN 2.1”, “NUR”)

documentation and technical specifications

source code and repository artifacts

logos, wordmarks, and visual identity elements

partner references and pilot naming conventions

domain usage and official communication channels

2.2 Out of Scope

commercial licensing agreements (handled separately)

trademark registration status statements (not asserted in this document unless officially recorded elsewhere)

Definitions

“Brand Elements”: names, logos, wordmarks, color palettes, typography, design patterns, and official visual assets.

“Official Artifacts”: materials published from the official repository and official channels under a specific release tag or recorded version.

“Derived Work”: any modification, fork, translation, or redistribution of official artifacts.

Ownership and Stewardship

4.1 Stewardship

NOORCHAIN brand and IP are stewarded under the governance structure defined for NOORCHAIN 2.1.

Strategic stewardship: Foundation governance body (or delegate)

Technical stewardship: Dev Sàrl (implementation owner)

Operational stewardship: operators and maintainers for controlled deployments

Reference:

docs/governance/GOVERNANCE_MODEL_2.1.md

4.2 Repository and Versioning

Official technical claims must be tied to:

a repository commit hash and/or release tag

a documented version number for text artifacts

References:

docs/RELEASE_PROCESS_2.1.md

docs/CHANGELOG_2.1.md

docs/NOORCHAIN_Index_2.1.md

Name and Mark Usage Rules

5.1 Allowed Uses (General)

The following are generally allowed if accurate and non-misleading:

referencing “NOORCHAIN 2.1” as an experimental/controlled sovereign EVM L1

referencing the token name “NUR” as the native fee asset (without price/value claims)

referencing PoSS as an application-layer mechanism separated from consensus

All uses must preserve the Legal-Light posture and avoid statements implying investment returns.

Reference:

docs/legal/LEGAL_LIGHT_POSTURE_2.1.md

docs/compliance/COMMUNICATIONS_POLICY_2.1.md

5.2 Prohibited Uses

The following are prohibited:

implying official endorsement of third-party products without written approval

claiming “mainnet public/open” status when the network is permissioned or controlled

using NOORCHAIN branding to market financial returns, yield, or investment products

distributing modified protocol binaries while presenting them as official NOORCHAIN releases

publishing internal operational endpoints, validator identities, or sensitive deployment details as “official” unless explicitly authorized

5.3 Status Integrity

When referring to NOORCHAIN 2.1 status, statements must be bounded and factual:

“controlled deployment”, “pilot environment”, “permissioned network” are acceptable

“public mainnet” must not be used unless formally declared via governance and release processes

docs/governance/GOVERNANCE_MODEL_2.1.md

docs/RELEASE_PROCESS_2.1.md

Documentation Usage and Attribution

6.1 Official Documentation

Official documentation is defined as:

documents in the repository under /docs

tied to a specific version and/or release tag

included in the documentation index

Reference:

docs/NOORCHAIN_Index_2.1.md

6.2 Derived Documentation (Forks, Translations)

Derived works must:

clearly state they are derived

preserve document IDs and original version references

include a statement of what was changed

avoid presenting derived statements as official protocol commitments

6.3 Quoting and Referencing

When quoting NOORCHAIN docs:

quote accurately and preserve context

cite document ID and version

avoid extracting statements that could be interpreted as financial promises

Software Artifacts and Licensing Posture

7.1 Official Builds and Releases

Only builds tied to an official release process may be described as “official”.

Requirements:

versioned source (commit hash)

reproducible build procedure

validation gates documented

References:

docs/RELEASE_PROCESS_2.1.md

docs/AUDIT_READINESS_2.1.md

7.2 Forks and Repackaging

Forks may exist, but must not:

use NOORCHAIN branding in a way that implies official affiliation

claim compatibility with NOORCHAIN 2.1 without passing documented compatibility gates

reuse official marks in a misleading manner

Reference:

docs/rpc/RPC_COMPAT_MATRIX_2.1.md

Visual Identity Controls

8.1 Approved Assets

Approved brand assets must be sourced from the official repository or a controlled asset store.

Rules:

do not modify logos/wordmarks without explicit approval

do not alter colors/typography in ways that create confusion about authenticity

do not combine NOORCHAIN marks with third-party marks without approval

8.2 Usage Context

NOORCHAIN brand elements may be used for:

documentation, technical demos, and controlled pilots

operator dashboards and internal tooling

official web presence and controlled communications

They must not be used for:

speculative promotions

investment solicitations framed as official project promises

third-party token listings implying official endorsement

References:

docs/compliance/COMMUNICATIONS_POLICY_2.1.md

docs/legal/LEGAL_LIGHT_POSTURE_2.1.md

Partner and Pilot Branding (Controlled Usage)

For pilots (e.g., NGO/school engagements):

partner naming must be accurate and consent-based

materials must specify pilot scope and controlled environment posture

avoid implying partner endorsement of the token as a financial product

Evidence:

partner approval record for public-facing materials (where applicable)

References:

docs/compliance/COMMUNICATIONS_POLICY_2.1.md

docs/PRIVACY_DATA_POLICY_2.1.md

Domain and Channel Policy

10.1 Official Channels

Official channels must be recorded and controlled. For any published statement that could be interpreted as official:

ensure it is issued from an official channel

tie it to a specific release or documented status

10.2 Impersonation and Misuse Response

If brand misuse is detected:

treat as an incident under incident response policy if it impacts trust or operational safety

document evidence (screenshots, URLs, timestamps)

escalate to governance for response decisions

Reference:

docs/governance/INCIDENT_RESPONSE_2.1.md

Enforcement and Change Control

This policy is governed under the NOORCHAIN 2.1 governance model.

Changes to this policy require:

documentation version bump

governance approval where the change affects external posture

changelog entry if it materially affects operations or communications
