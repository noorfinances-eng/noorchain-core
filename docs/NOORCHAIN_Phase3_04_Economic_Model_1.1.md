# 1. Core Economic Principles

NOORCHAIN adopts a **transparent, non-inflationary, Swiss-compliant economic model**  
based on the following principles:

1. **Fixed Supply (immutable):**  
   Total supply = **299,792,458 NUR**  
   (symbolic reference to the speed of light)

2. **Utility Token (non-financial):**  
   NUR is a **pure utility token** for the NOORCHAIN ecosystem:  
   - PoSS participation  
   - dApps  
   - Curators validation  
   - On-chain governance  
   - Access to ecosystem tools  

3. **Hybrid Consensus Model:**  
   - Cosmos SDK + Ethermint for security, EVM compatibility and speed  
   - PoSS (Proof of Signal Social) for social-layer incentives  
   - PoSS is **not a mining system**, but a reward distribution rule for  
     verified positive social actions

4. **Swiss Legal Light CH Compliance:**  
   - No custody  
   - No staking APR  
   - No guaranteed returns  
   - No financial promotion  
   - No internal fiat conversion  
   - External PSP partners only  
   - Transparent governance  

5. **Curators as central actors:**  
   Curators (Bronze / Silver / Gold) validate PoSS signals and receive  
   30% of each PoSS reward.

# 2. Economic Allocation (Genesis — Immutable)

The NOORCHAIN economic model is based on a **permanent 5/5/5/5/80 allocation**,  
validated across all legal, governance and technical documents.

| Allocation Pool     | Percentage | Description |
|---------------------|------------|-------------|
| Foundation Reserve  | 5%         | Non-profit, public-good, governance & transparency |
| Noor Dev Sàrl       | 5%         | Technical development, infrastructure, integrations |
| PoSS Stimulus Pool  | 5%         | Rewards for NGOs, schools, associations on early phases |
| Pre-sale Pool       | 5%         | Optional, strictly vested, controlled via multi-sig |
| PoSS Mintable Pool  | 80%        | Long-term PoSS issuance over decades |

### 2.1 Legal Constraints  
- These percentages are **immutable**.  
- They cannot be changed by governance.  
- Funds cannot be moved between pools.  
- No new tokens can ever be minted.

# 3. PoSS Rewards Economic Model

PoSS rewards operate under strict **non-financial rules**:

### 3.1 Split  
- **70%** — to the participant sending the positive signal  
- **30%** — to the curator validating the signal  

### 3.2 Halving  
- **Every 8 years**, PoSS raw reward decreases by 50%.  
- Halving is purely **mechanical**, not financial.  

### 3.3 Daily Limits  
- Max signals per day (per participant)  
- Max signals per curator per day  
- Max reward per day per participant  
- All governance-adjustable (except 70/30 split which is structural)

### 3.4 Non-financial nature  
PoSS is legally structured so that rewards are:  
- symbolic  
- capped  
- non-income  
- non-yield  
- not investment-related

# 4. System Emissions Timeline (Non-financial)

The PoSS 80% pool is expected to last **25–40 years**, depending on the  
halving schedule and usage patterns.

### Simplified timeline:
- Years 1–8 : High activity (pre-halving)  
- Years 9–16 : 50% reduced  
- Years 17–24 : 25% of initial  
- Years 25–32 : 12.5% of initial  

This structure ensures long-term sustainability without inflation.

---

# 5. Value Creation (Allowed Under Legal Light)

NUR may increase in value because of:  
- Market demand  
- Ecosystem adoption  
- Utility in dApps  
- Listings on external orderbook exchanges (e.g., MEXC)  
- Growing network effects  
- Limited supply  

**But NOORCHAIN never promises or advertises financial return.**  
This is core to Swiss Legal Light CH compliance.

# 8. Sustainability Model

The NOORCHAIN economic design is optimized for:  
- 30+ years of PoSS issuance  
- Zero inflation  
- Swiss transparency  
- Long-term adoption  
- Ethical token distribution  
- Non-speculative usage  

---

# 9. Founder Compensation Model (Transparent)

Founder benefits come exclusively from:

1. **The 5% Noor Dev Sàrl allocation (vested)**  
2. **Optional grants** for development  
3. **Possible exit in a future acquisition (order-book based)**  
4. **No extraction from the Foundation**  
5. **Monthly selling cap of 0.5% of founder wallet**  

This keeps NOORCHAIN aligned with Swiss ethical blockchain standards.
