NOORCHAIN 1.0 — Economic Model
Phase 3 — Official Specification
Version 1.1 (Omega Clean)
Last Updated: 2025-12-03
1. Core Economic Principles

NOORCHAIN is built on a transparent, non-inflationary and Swiss-compliant economic model.
Its basic principles are:

Fixed Total Supply (immutable)
Total supply is permanently capped at 299,792,458 NUR, a symbolic reference to the speed of light.

Utility Token (non-financial)
NUR is exclusively a utility token used for:
– PoSS participation
– dApps (NOOR Pay, Curators Hub, CCN Studio)
– Curator validation
– Governance interactions
– Access to ecosystem tools

Hybrid Consensus Architecture
– Cosmos SDK + Ethermint (EVM) for security and flexibility
– PoSS (Proof of Signal Social) as a controlled social-layer reward mechanism
PoSS is not mining and not a yield product.

Swiss Legal Light CH Compliance
– No custody of user funds
– No promised returns
– No APR, APY, staking yield or investment language
– No fiat conversion inside NOORCHAIN
– Only external PSP partners allowed (e.g., Mt Pelerin, NOWPayments)
– Strict transparency and governance requirements

Curators as Key Actors
Curators (Bronze / Silver / Gold) validate PoSS signals and receive 30% of each reward.

2. Genesis Economic Allocation (Immutable)

The entire token supply is allocated at genesis using the permanent 5 / 5 / 5 / 5 / 80 rule.

Allocation Pool	Percentage	Description
Foundation Reserve	5%	Non-profit governance, public good operations, transparency
Noor Dev Sàrl	5%	Development, integrations, infrastructure, R&D
PoSS Stimulus Pool	5%	Early support for NGOs, schools, associations
Pre-sale Pool	5%	Optional, fully vested, restricted to Swiss investors
PoSS Mintable Reserve	80%	Long-term PoSS issuance over decades
2.1 Legal and governance constraints

These percentages are immutable.

No reallocation between pools is permitted.

No new tokens can ever be minted.

Pre-sale pool may only be used under:
– strict vesting,
– multi-sig verification,
– Swiss investor rules.

The economic model must remain strictly non-investment according to Swiss Legal Light CH.

3. PoSS Rewards Economic Model

PoSS ensures fair, capped and non-financial distribution of tokens based on verified positive actions.

3.1 Reward Split (Immutable)

The structural reward split is hard-coded:

70% to the participant

30% to the curator

This rule cannot be changed by governance.

3.2 Halving Schedule

Every 8 years, raw PoSS rewards are reduced by half.
This is purely mechanical and independent of market conditions.

3.3 Daily Limits (Governance-adjustable)

To ensure fairness and avoid farming:

Maximum signals per participant per day

Maximum signals per curator per day

Maximum reward per participant per day

Maximum reward per curator per day

These parameters can be updated through on-chain governance, except the 70/30 split, which is permanent.

3.4 Non-financial Positioning

PoSS is structured so that rewards are:

symbolic

capped

transparent

predictable

not linked to performance or investment

not marketed as income

This ensures strict compliance with FINMA guidelines.

4. Long-Term Emission Timeline (Non-Inflationary)

The 80% PoSS reserve is expected to last 25 to 40 years, depending on adoption and halving cycles.

Approximate timeline:

Years 1–8 : initial emission

Years 9–16 : 50% reduction

Years 17–24 : 25% of initial

Years 25–32 : 12.5% of initial

After each halving era, the raw reward per signal decreases accordingly.

5. Market Model (Allowed vs Forbidden)

NOORCHAIN separates what is allowed from what is prohibited to maintain Legal Light status.

5.1 Allowed

Orderbook exchange listing (e.g., MEXC)

Free market trading (without market-making by Foundation/Sàrl)

dApps generating utility demand

Integration with external PSPs

Public grants

Ecosystem partnerships

SaaS revenue for the Sàrl

5.2 Forbidden

Any form of yield farming

APR / APY / staking return products

Internal liquidity pools

Market-making by the Foundation

Guaranteed token value

Investment promotion

Custodial services

6. Sustainability & Governance Model

The NOORCHAIN economic architecture is designed for:

Zero inflation

Multi-decade longevity

Transparent governance

Clear separation between Foundation (non-profit) and Sàrl (development)

Ethical distribution of tokens

Sustainable ecosystem growth

7. Founder Compensation (Transparent Model)

The founder’s economic participation is strictly regulated:

5% Dev Sàrl allocation (vested).

Optional public or institutional grants.

Possible exit through market mechanisms (orderbook).

No access to Foundation funds.

Maximum 0.5% per month sale limit (recommended governance rule).

These constraints ensure alignment with long-term sustainability and Swiss transparency norms.

8. Summary

The NOORCHAIN economic model is:

fixed

transparent

legally compliant

sustainable

utility-based

non-speculative

governance-aligned

built for long-term ecosystem growth
